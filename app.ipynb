He was a gentle and brilliant child. Our teacher always advised us to get his help if we couldn’t understand something,” Khan recalled, striding through village maize fields.Even more incredibly, Singh wanted to help the 2,500 villagers in Gah, on a plateau of muddy rock and bushy forest 100km from Islamabad near the ultra-modern motorway that runs almost to the Indian border.“I never imagined Manmohan would one day bring so many blessings to our village. He did what our own government still refuses to do,” recalled Khan, who is Singh’s last surviving classmate left in the village. But the last eight years is a tale of generosity, squandered opportunity and political short-termism that leaves Pakistan with an embarrassing predicament now that President Asif Ali Zardari has invited Singh to visit later this year.The model village that Singh dreamt of lies in tatters. Buildings that cost tens of thousands of dollars stand empty and unfinished. The only question is what, if anything, will Pakistan do to fix it?Not long after taking office, Singh wrote to Pakistan’s then ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, asking that Gah be earmarked for development.Musharraf, at the time working on peace talks that he hoped would resolve India and Pakistan’s conflict over Kashmir, was happy to oblige.The provincial government in Punjab built a decent road from the motorway to the village, high schools for boys and girls, a hospital, veterinary clinic and hooked the village up to the water supply.Singh sent an Indian firm to instal solar-powered street lights, solar-powered lights to 51 households that did not have electricity and a water heating system at the mosque close to the site of his destroyed home.But the project stalled after elections in 2008 swept former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-N party to power in Punjab, booting out of office Pakistan Muslim League-Q and Musharraf stepped down.The high schools and hospital stand empty. No teacher or doctor has been appointed, because the villagers say, credit for the development would have gone to the previous regime and not the new government.“We contacted the district administration and members of the ruling party time and again. They say there are no funds for the facilities and that they are trying to get it from the government,” said Ashiq Hussain, the mayor of Gah.But a Punjab government spokesman said it was “absolutely baseless” to suggest it had abandoned the Gah development project for political reasons.“No scheme has been stopped anywhere in the province on such a basis,” Pervez Rasheed said.“The hospital in the village is still under completion and the boundary wall plus equipment is being provided this year. Staff will be recruited when it’s completed,” he said, referring to plans to open the high schools in September.Villagers young and old are united in their hope that the return of their lost boy sometime later this year will be the spur. “Everybody wants to see him and say thank you. We also want him to come soon because we think the abandoned development will be completed for his visit and we will get staff in our schools and hospitals,” Khan said.The mayor hopes that if Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif attends village celebrations for Singh’s 80th birthday in September, development work will resume.Hussain, whose late uncle Raja Mohammed Ali met Singh in New Delhi, is pushing full steam ahead with preparations to welcome home the “great son” of Gah.“We are going to bring all the musicians, drum beaters and flute players here to perform at his arrival. We will dance and celebrate.“We want him to establish an unbreakable friendship between Pakistan and India.”No matter Pakistan and India’s bitter rivalry, most people in Gah are proud of Singh for going on to govern 1.2 billion people in the world’s largest democracy.“He is the son of our soil and we want him to become the hero of Pakistan-India friendship. We would like him to solve the Kashmir issue and I will talk to him about this when he comes here,” Khan said.In Singh’s old primary school, which unlike his home is still standing, his mark sheet has been put up on the wall, exhorting the next generation of children to take his lead, and go ahead and rule the world.\\n Recommended For You\\nKeep your hands happy: Essential hand care tips\\nHow much sleep do you really need?\\nHeadache: Different types of headaches and their remedies \\nDubai gold pricing: Why an attraction for gold enthusiasts?\\nEssential hair care tips for beautiful and healthy locks\\nSign up for our golf newsletterGet news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday.

The expansion has encroached on the largely unexplored complex of Dahshour, where Pharaoh Sneferu experimented with the first smooth-sided pyramids that his son Khufu, also known as Cheops, employed at the more famous Giza Plateau nearby, when he built the Great Pyramid.Authorities issued an order in January to remove the construction equipment, instructing the Interior Ministry’s police to implement it, but no action has been taken.Egyptian villagers hold a banner in front of the 4,500-year-old ‘bent’ pyramid of Pharaoh Sneferu outside the village of Dahshour, 80 km south of Cairo. — APAlso, a security vacuum that followed Egypt’s 2011 popular uprising has encouraged looters to step up their illegal digs, clashing with guards at the site.On Monday, dozens of young protesters at the site about 40 kilometers south of Cairo held up a sign that read: “God does not bless a nation that gives up its heritage.”Ramadan Mohammed, a 20-year old student from the nearby village of Mansheyet Dahshour, said he witnessed looting himself. He said he wanted to show that Dahshour residents were not responsible and should not to be blamed.“I’m here to see the government’s response,” Mohammed said, with the shadow of Pharaoh Sneferu’s Bent Pyramid looming in the background. “The military was in control of the country all this past period, they should have protected the site and caught the looters. Instead, they stood there doing nothing,” he complained. Antiquities experts warn that construction of the new cemetery also endangers the ancient complex.Villagers say their cemeteries are full, but authorities do not give permits or land for new ones, so they grabbed what they insist is empty desert land to erect family tombs.The area, designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage site, also includes the adjacent Valley Temple and the 3,800-year-old Black Pyramid of Amenemhat III.Nearby is Sneferu’s Bent Pyramid, some 700 years older, with its distinctive bent sides believed to have been caused when the builders had to correct the angle halfway through construction. Farther away is the Red Pyramid, where Sneferu’s builders got the angles right, producing the first smooth-sided pyramid, evolving from the stepped structures built by earlier dynasties.Antiquity restoration specialist Marwa el-Zeini, who was at the protest, blamed authorities for failing to stop the cemetery construction.Mohamed Youssef, head of antiquities for Dahshour, dismissed the protest as a media stunt.Monica Hanna, an independent archaeologist who has worked at Dahshour, praised the local initiative.“It’s the first time the local community is taking a step forward, rather than the academics,” Hanna said. “Previously, it would always appear that the academics were against the residents.”\\n Recommended For You\\nKeep your hands happy: Essential hand care tips\\nHow much sleep do you really need?\\nHeadache: Different types of headaches and their remedies \\nDubai gold pricing: Why an attraction for gold enthusiasts?\\nEssential hair care tips for beautiful and healthy locks\\nSign up for our golf newsletterGet news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday.

While current account will increase from 0.9 per cent in 2017 to 5.5 per cent this year but will slip to 3.2 per cent in 2019. Similarly, budget balance deficit will shrink from 9 per cent of GDP in 2017 to 7 per cent this year but will increase again to 7.6 next year due to slip in oil prices expected in 2019.Malik said there could be some downside pressure to real oil GDP growth forecasts for 2018 if the GCC countries continue to produce oil at their first quarter of 2018 levels. Its current assumption is for steady annual production in 2018 at the 2017 levels. Some countries, such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, lowered their output in first quarter of 2018.Crude oil prices slid below $80 per barrel on the weekend after Saudi Arabia and Russia said Opec and its allies may boost output in the second half of this year. Brent crude futures stood at $75.35 a barrel at 0913GMT while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were traded at $66.69.\"Even in this event, we still see a solid rise in the GCC oil revenue with the higher oil price,\" Malik added.Emirates NBD also revised oil prices forecast higher with Brent averaging around $69 per barrel this year.\"Prices should begin to taper off slightly by the end of the year even with a relatively wide deficit as we think the risk of a broader slowdown in global growth will become more apparent by the end of 2018,\" Khatija Haque, head of Mena Research, said in a note.Oil to remain volatileMR Raghu, managing director, MarmoreMena Intelligence, believes that oil prices could exhibit significant volatility going ahead due to US withdrawal from Iranian nuclear deal, exacerbated situation by the fall in output from Venezuela and constraints in US production growth.International Monetary Fund has cut its 2018 oil GDP growth forecasts for most GCC countries, citing the medium-term outlook for oil prices remained highly uncertain and subdued despite the upward revision of oil price assumptions for 2018.According to IMF, oil prices are expected to average $62 a barrel in 2018, which is below the level most GCC governments need to balance their budgets, this will keep their public finances in deficit.According to Raghu, some of the factors exerting upward pressure on oil in the coming months would be continued pipeline constraints and infrastructure bottlenecks faced by US Shale production, geopolitical tensions in several producing nations, and US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed restrictions on Iranian oil exports. While, the downside risks to oil prices are, potential weakening in compliance in the Opec/non-Opec production cuts or outright termination of the accord, growing oil production from Libya and Nigeria, and faster-than-anticipated US shale production.- waheedabbas@khaleejtimes.com\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n Recommended For You\\nKeep your hands happy: Essential hand care tips\\nHow much sleep do you really need?\\nHeadache: Different types of headaches and their remedies \\nDubai gold pricing: Why an attraction for gold enthusiasts?\\nEssential hair care tips for beautiful and healthy locks\\nSign up for our golf newsletterGet news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday.

He added that he did not know if anyone was injured.The Seattle Times newspaper reported that three people were rescued from the water. Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the rescues with the Skagit County Sheriff’s Office.The cause of the collapse was not immediately known. It was not raining in the area, Francis said.The bridge was built in 1955, according to the website for the privately run National Bridge Inventory Database. The highway and bridge are the main corridor for car traffic between Seattle and Vancouver, Canada.The Skagit County Sheriff’s Office, in a statement on its Facebook page, asked people to avoid the area to make room for emergency responders.“Please try to stay off land and cell phones as the volume of calls has overloaded the system and first responders are not able to make needed calls due to line overload,” the statement advised residents.The collapse comes nearly six years after another bridge fell in Minnesota and raised concerns about faulty infrastructure in the United States.In August 2007, about 1,000 feet (305 meters) of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River during the evening rush hour. Vehicles plummeted into the water, killing 13 people and injuring another 145.In a subsequent probe of the fatal collapse, the US National Transportation Safety Board found more than a dozen steel support plates suspected of causing the disaster were deficient in size, and a routine inspection would not have uncovered the problem.\\n Recommended For You\\nKeep your hands happy: Essential hand care tips\\nHow much sleep do you really need?\\nHeadache: Different types of headaches and their remedies \\nDubai gold pricing: Why an attraction for gold enthusiasts?\\nEssential hair care tips for beautiful and healthy locks\\nSign up for our golf newsletterGet news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday.

He was a gentle and brilliant child. Our teacher always advised us to get his help if we couldn’t understand something,” Khan recalled, striding through village maize fields.Even more incredibly, Singh wanted to help the 2,500 villagers in Gah, on a plateau of muddy rock and bushy forest 100km from Islamabad near the ultra-modern motorway that runs almost to the Indian border.“I never imagined Manmohan would one day bring so many blessings to our village. He did what our own government still refuses to do,” recalled Khan, who is Singh’s last surviving classmate left in the village. But the last eight years is a tale of generosity, squandered opportunity and political short-termism that leaves Pakistan with an embarrassing predicament now that President Asif Ali Zardari has invited Singh to visit later this year.The model village that Singh dreamt of lies in tatters. Buildings that cost tens of thousands of dollars stand empty and unfinished. The only question is what, if anything, will Pakistan do to fix it?Not long after taking office, Singh wrote to Pakistan’s then ruler, General Pervez Musharraf, asking that Gah be earmarked for development.Musharraf, at the time working on peace talks that he hoped would resolve India and Pakistan’s conflict over Kashmir, was happy to oblige.The provincial government in Punjab built a decent road from the motorway to the village, high schools for boys and girls, a hospital, veterinary clinic and hooked the village up to the water supply.Singh sent an Indian firm to instal solar-powered street lights, solar-powered lights to 51 households that did not have electricity and a water heating system at the mosque close to the site of his destroyed home.But the project stalled after elections in 2008 swept former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s Pakistan Muslim League-N party to power in Punjab, booting out of office Pakistan Muslim League-Q and Musharraf stepped down.The high schools and hospital stand empty. No teacher or doctor has been appointed, because the villagers say, credit for the development would have gone to the previous regime and not the new government.“We contacted the district administration and members of the ruling party time and again. They say there are no funds for the facilities and that they are trying to get it from the government,” said Ashiq Hussain, the mayor of Gah.But a Punjab government spokesman said it was “absolutely baseless” to suggest it had abandoned the Gah development project for political reasons.“No scheme has been stopped anywhere in the province on such a basis,” Pervez Rasheed said.“The hospital in the village is still under completion and the boundary wall plus equipment is being provided this year. Staff will be recruited when it’s completed,” he said, referring to plans to open the high schools in September.Villagers young and old are united in their hope that the return of their lost boy sometime later this year will be the spur. “Everybody wants to see him and say thank you. We also want him to come soon because we think the abandoned development will be completed for his visit and we will get staff in our schools and hospitals,” Khan said.The mayor hopes that if Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif attends village celebrations for Singh’s 80th birthday in September, development work will resume.Hussain, whose late uncle Raja Mohammed Ali met Singh in New Delhi, is pushing full steam ahead with preparations to welcome home the “great son” of Gah.“We are going to bring all the musicians, drum beaters and flute players here to perform at his arrival. We will dance and celebrate.“We want him to establish an unbreakable friendship between Pakistan and India.”No matter Pakistan and India’s bitter rivalry, most people in Gah are proud of Singh for going on to govern 1.2 billion people in the world’s largest democracy.“He is the son of our soil and we want him to become the hero of Pakistan-India friendship. We would like him to solve the Kashmir issue and I will talk to him about this when he comes here,” Khan said.In Singh’s old primary school, which unlike his home is still standing, his mark sheet has been put up on the wall, exhorting the next generation of children to take his lead, and go ahead and rule the world.\\n Recommended For You\\nKeep your hands happy: Essential hand care tips\\nHow much sleep do you really need?\\nHeadache: Different types of headaches and their remedies \\nDubai gold pricing: Why an attraction for gold enthusiasts?\\nEssential hair care tips for beautiful and healthy locks\\nSign up for our golf newsletterGet news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday.

The expansion has encroached on the largely unexplored complex of Dahshour, where Pharaoh Sneferu experimented with the first smooth-sided pyramids that his son Khufu, also known as Cheops, employed at the more famous Giza Plateau nearby, when he built the Great Pyramid.Authorities issued an order in January to remove the construction equipment, instructing the Interior Ministry’s police to implement it, but no action has been taken.Egyptian villagers hold a banner in front of the 4,500-year-old ‘bent’ pyramid of Pharaoh Sneferu outside the village of Dahshour, 80 km south of Cairo. — APAlso, a security vacuum that followed Egypt’s 2011 popular uprising has encouraged looters to step up their illegal digs, clashing with guards at the site.On Monday, dozens of young protesters at the site about 40 kilometers south of Cairo held up a sign that read: “God does not bless a nation that gives up its heritage.”Ramadan Mohammed, a 20-year old student from the nearby village of Mansheyet Dahshour, said he witnessed looting himself. He said he wanted to show that Dahshour residents were not responsible and should not to be blamed.“I’m here to see the government’s response,” Mohammed said, with the shadow of Pharaoh Sneferu’s Bent Pyramid looming in the background. “The military was in control of the country all this past period, they should have protected the site and caught the looters. Instead, they stood there doing nothing,” he complained. Antiquities experts warn that construction of the new cemetery also endangers the ancient complex.Villagers say their cemeteries are full, but authorities do not give permits or land for new ones, so they grabbed what they insist is empty desert land to erect family tombs.The area, designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage site, also includes the adjacent Valley Temple and the 3,800-year-old Black Pyramid of Amenemhat III.Nearby is Sneferu’s Bent Pyramid, some 700 years older, with its distinctive bent sides believed to have been caused when the builders had to correct the angle halfway through construction. Farther away is the Red Pyramid, where Sneferu’s builders got the angles right, producing the first smooth-sided pyramid, evolving from the stepped structures built by earlier dynasties.Antiquity restoration specialist Marwa el-Zeini, who was at the protest, blamed authorities for failing to stop the cemetery construction.Mohamed Youssef, head of antiquities for Dahshour, dismissed the protest as a media stunt.Monica Hanna, an independent archaeologist who has worked at Dahshour, praised the local initiative.“It’s the first time the local community is taking a step forward, rather than the academics,” Hanna said. “Previously, it would always appear that the academics were against the residents.”\\n Recommended For You\\nKeep your hands happy: Essential hand care tips\\nHow much sleep do you really need?\\nHeadache: Different types of headaches and their remedies \\nDubai gold pricing: Why an attraction for gold enthusiasts?\\nEssential hair care tips for beautiful and healthy locks\\nSign up for our golf newsletterGet news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday.

While current account will increase from 0.9 per cent in 2017 to 5.5 per cent this year but will slip to 3.2 per cent in 2019. Similarly, budget balance deficit will shrink from 9 per cent of GDP in 2017 to 7 per cent this year but will increase again to 7.6 next year due to slip in oil prices expected in 2019.Malik said there could be some downside pressure to real oil GDP growth forecasts for 2018 if the GCC countries continue to produce oil at their first quarter of 2018 levels. Its current assumption is for steady annual production in 2018 at the 2017 levels. Some countries, such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE, lowered their output in first quarter of 2018.Crude oil prices slid below $80 per barrel on the weekend after Saudi Arabia and Russia said Opec and its allies may boost output in the second half of this year. Brent crude futures stood at $75.35 a barrel at 0913GMT while US West Texas Intermediate crude futures were traded at $66.69.\"Even in this event, we still see a solid rise in the GCC oil revenue with the higher oil price,\" Malik added.Emirates NBD also revised oil prices forecast higher with Brent averaging around $69 per barrel this year.\"Prices should begin to taper off slightly by the end of the year even with a relatively wide deficit as we think the risk of a broader slowdown in global growth will become more apparent by the end of 2018,\" Khatija Haque, head of Mena Research, said in a note.Oil to remain volatileMR Raghu, managing director, MarmoreMena Intelligence, believes that oil prices could exhibit significant volatility going ahead due to US withdrawal from Iranian nuclear deal, exacerbated situation by the fall in output from Venezuela and constraints in US production growth.International Monetary Fund has cut its 2018 oil GDP growth forecasts for most GCC countries, citing the medium-term outlook for oil prices remained highly uncertain and subdued despite the upward revision of oil price assumptions for 2018.According to IMF, oil prices are expected to average $62 a barrel in 2018, which is below the level most GCC governments need to balance their budgets, this will keep their public finances in deficit.According to Raghu, some of the factors exerting upward pressure on oil in the coming months would be continued pipeline constraints and infrastructure bottlenecks faced by US Shale production, geopolitical tensions in several producing nations, and US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed restrictions on Iranian oil exports. While, the downside risks to oil prices are, potential weakening in compliance in the Opec/non-Opec production cuts or outright termination of the accord, growing oil production from Libya and Nigeria, and faster-than-anticipated US shale production.- waheedabbas@khaleejtimes.com\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n Recommended For You\\nKeep your hands happy: Essential hand care tips\\nHow much sleep do you really need?\\nHeadache: Different types of headaches and their remedies \\nDubai gold pricing: Why an attraction for gold enthusiasts?\\nEssential hair care tips for beautiful and healthy locks\\nSign up for our golf newsletterGet news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday.

He added that he did not know if anyone was injured.The Seattle Times newspaper reported that three people were rescued from the water. Reuters was not able to immediately confirm the rescues with the Skagit County Sheriff’s Office.The cause of the collapse was not immediately known. It was not raining in the area, Francis said.The bridge was built in 1955, according to the website for the privately run National Bridge Inventory Database. The highway and bridge are the main corridor for car traffic between Seattle and Vancouver, Canada.The Skagit County Sheriff’s Office, in a statement on its Facebook page, asked people to avoid the area to make room for emergency responders.“Please try to stay off land and cell phones as the volume of calls has overloaded the system and first responders are not able to make needed calls due to line overload,” the statement advised residents.The collapse comes nearly six years after another bridge fell in Minnesota and raised concerns about faulty infrastructure in the United States.In August 2007, about 1,000 feet (305 meters) of the I-35W bridge in Minneapolis collapsed into the Mississippi River during the evening rush hour. Vehicles plummeted into the water, killing 13 people and injuring another 145.In a subsequent probe of the fatal collapse, the US National Transportation Safety Board found more than a dozen steel support plates suspected of causing the disaster were deficient in size, and a routine inspection would not have uncovered the problem.\\n Recommended For You\\nKeep your hands happy: Essential hand care tips\\nHow much sleep do you really need?\\nHeadache: Different types of headaches and their remedies \\nDubai gold pricing: Why an attraction for gold enthusiasts?\\nEssential hair care tips for beautiful and healthy locks\\nSign up for our golf newsletterGet news and views from the world of golf delivered to your inbox every Wednesday.
