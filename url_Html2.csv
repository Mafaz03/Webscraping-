                        China
In Beijing this week, the tenth-year milestone of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be marked at a forum that highlights this often-debated model for economic development.
Large signs reading ""The Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation"" are displayed next to a bustling Beijing road. The previous forums convened in 2017 and 2019.  
This program, championed by China's President Xi Jinping, has provided funding for numerous global infrastructure projects, including ports, power plants, and railways. Nevertheless, the initiative has received criticism for its approach to providing loans to developing nations, which often results in them incurring substantial debt.
Wang Yiwei, the Director of the Institute of International Affairs at China's Renmin University, asserts that BRI encourages a collaborative approach to development with partner nations, providing them with paths to modernization.
Recent events, such as the construction of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in Indonesia, which commenced earlier this month, underscore the mixed reception BRI has encountered. While this 142-kilometer railway significantly reduces travel time between Jakarta and Bandung, it was marred by delays and escalating costs. Originally expected to launch in 2019, disputes over land acquisition, environmental concerns, and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the project. Furthermore, the estimated cost of 66.7 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion USD) ballooned to 113 trillion rupiah ($7.3 billion USD).
Similarly, the $5.9 billion Chinese-built railway linking Laos' capital, Vientiane, to the southern Chinese city of Kunming began operations in 2021, with over 60% of the investment being borrowed – an unusually high percentage for an infrastructure project, according to foreign experts. This has led to the initiative being perceived by some as a ""debt trap.""
Chinese contractors are also constructing a high-speed rail line from Bangkok to the Laos border, expected to be operational by 2028.
An example of a debt issue emerged earlier this year when a power plant in Jordan, once touted as a groundbreaking project to provide the country with a significant energy source, turned sour. Jordan now finds itself in an international legal battle and billions of dollars in debt to China for a plant that is no longer necessary for its energy needs, due to subsequent agreements made since the project's inception.
A ""risk prevention"" approach will be critical for the future of the Belt and Road Initiative, given the growing complications in a world marked by ongoing conflicts.
The Belt and Road Initiative Forum is scheduled to commence on October 18.

                        China
Kenyan President William Ruto has arrived in Beijing to participate in the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, scheduled for two days in the Chinese capital.
This forum holds great diplomatic significance for China, as it's the most important event of the year and a notable celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
Over 140 countries and 30 international organizations, including leaders, officials, and representatives from various sectors, have confirmed their participation.
The Belt and Road Initiative, initiated by China in 2013, aims to create trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia, Europe, Africa, and beyond along the historic Silk Road trade routes.
In the past decade, over 150 countries and 30 international organizations have engaged with the BRI framework, marking a significant milestone in global cooperation.
William Ruto intends to ask China for a $1 billion loan and a debt repayment restructuring plan, the country's vice-president said on Friday.
According to Rigathi Gachagua, the head of state, who criticized his predecessor's heavy borrowing from Beijing, will visit China at an unspecified date. He will ask for ""more time to slowly repay the debt"", as well as a billion dollars to complete road projects delayed by lack of funding.
Kenya, one of East Africa's largest economies, has accumulated more than $68 billion in debt, equivalent to 67% of its gross domestic product.
""We are a responsible government, we can't say we won't pay the debt,"" Rigathi Gachagua told a local radio station.
China, which William Ruto has not visited since his election in August 2022, is the country's second-largest creditor, after the World Bank.
In Mombasa, East Africa's largest port on the Kenyan coast, it is financing the construction of a new terminal.
Beijing has also lent $5 billion (€4.7 billion) for the realization of the most expensive infrastructure project since the country's independence in 1963: the train line that since 2017 has linked the port city of Mombasa to Naivasha, in the Rift Valley, via the capital Nairobi.
During the election campaign, William Ruto had denounced the loans of his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta, pledging to find other ways of stimulating development to build the country's necessary infrastructure.
China has rejected criticism that its lavish loans are plunging some countries, particularly in Africa, into debt overload.
During a visit to Kenya in July, Beijing's head of diplomacy, Wang Yi, praised bilateral cooperation and a ""win-win"" partnership.
Despite a dynamic economy, around a third of Kenya's population lives in poverty.
Economic growth slowed to 4.8% last year, from 7.6% in 2021, hit by the global fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a devastating regional drought that hit the country's vital agricultural sector.
Inflation remained high, at an annual rate of 6.8% last month.
In July, global ratings' agency Fitch Ratings downgraded Kenya's ability to repay international lenders from ""stable to negative"", citing tax hikes and social unrest.

                        Madagascar
Authorities in Madagascar have started works on the country's first motorway linking the capital, Antananarivo, to Tamatave, the country's economic hub and largest port.
Egyptian company Samcrete will be in charge of the 4-year project for a budget of nearly $1 billion.
""The highway will allow us to relieve the congestion of the national road number 2 because in fact it is estimated that the traffic will be multiplied by 5 in the next three years. So it will be unbearable for the national road number 2 to handle this extra traffic"", said Public Works Minister of Madagascar, Jerry Hatrefindrazana.
The project has sparked controversy amongst the population. Farmers are one group particularly affected.
""We are in the middle of the rice transplanting period, right at the moment when our rice fields will be destroyed. And we have been waiting for the state to take action for us farmers. In all the speeches, no official spoke about the farmers"", complained farmer Roland Edie Rakotodramasy.
Others, like teacher Pauline Ramialisoa, remain convinced about the overall benefits.
""Traffic will be faster, cars will not use much gasoline, and the transport of goods from inside and outside will be more fluid"", she said
One of the Egyptian companies involved in the project, EGAAD, stressed the environmental advantages of the new infrastructure.
""This highway that will link the capital to the main port, the economic hub of the country, will ease a lot of things, reducing an 11-hour journey to a 2.5-hour journey. It will help to reduce CO2 emissions by 25 to 30%"", claims EGAAD group president, Reda Boulos.
The first stage of the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the president's mandate in 2023.

A new Chinese-built expressway in the Kenyan capital Nairobi will help boost the economy of the African nation, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for transportation and infrastructure, James Wainaina Macharia, said on Saturday.
The expressway opened to traffic for trial runs on Saturday and is expected to increase local employment, ease traffic jams, and bring a raft of economic benefits to the notoriously congested city.
Macharia hailed the expressway as one of the 'best pieces of infrastructure' ever built on the African continent.
""This road will have a very, very big impact in terms of mobility of Kenyans, visitors, businessmen, businesswomen, tourists. This is one of the best pieces of infrastructure ever done in Africa. In fact, it’s the longest expressway in Africa. So we are very proud today (Saturday) to come to witness the start of the trial run and monitor to make sure that indeed the expressway will be operated seamlessly and to a very high standard,"" he said.
The expressway stretches 27 kilometres through the heart of Nairobi, connecting Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Nairobi's Central Business District, the National Museum and the Presidential Palace.
More than 10,000 people have already registered to use the expressway, with an average of 800 people registering every day.
""Definitely, I will use it often. It's convenient, and hopefully, it will remain like that for the rest of its lifetime,"" said one Nairobi motorist.
The expressway is already creating direct employment opportunities for Nairobi's workers, with employees at the state-of-the-art expressway monitoring centre welcoming the opportunity to learn new technologies and software that keep the road running smoothly.
""We are doing the traffic monitoring and coping with the automatic detection system. We are able to detect if there is any congestion in the expressway if there is any pedestrian crossing if there is any vehicle reversing in the expressway. And thus, we are able to reach out to the responsible department to handle the abnormality on the expressway. We provide our country with a very smart, smooth and safe and speedy travel experience. We are able to learn a lot of software here as we learnt about the software which enables the cameras. Also, in the monitoring centre, I've learnt some Chinese words,"" said Martha, an employee working at the expressway monitoring centre.
The 73.5 billion shillings (about $648 million) road is expected to cut travel time from the south to the west of Nairobi to about 20 minutes from two hours currently during peak time.
The expressway was financed and built by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership model. Full-scale construction of the infrastructure project began in September 2020 and was completed a year ahead of schedule.
Building the expressway created more than 6,000 direct jobs, benefiting 200 sub-contractors and hundreds of other local suppliers of building materials such as steel, sand, cement and ballast.

Congo - Cameroon integration: 312 km road worth $180m operationalized
By Africanews

                                          10/03/2020
                        Republic of the Congo
A 312 kilometre road linking Congolese capital Brazzaville to Yaoundé in Cameroon has gone operational.
The road is part of the integration plan of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), which aims to interconnect the capitals of its eleven member countries.
The asphalt road which cost over $180 million starts from Ketta to Ntam on the Cameroonian border. 90% of it was pre-financed by the African Development Bank
Inaugurating the road, Congolese President, Denis Sassou Nguesso, challenged ECCAS countries to work to better connect the economic community.
“Take the case of Congo, it is connected to Cameroon, we are there. Congo connected to the Central African Republic, we are not there yet. I think we’ll get there. Plans are underway for the Congo to be linked to the DRC thanks to a road-rail bridge over the Congo River.”
The communication route designed to open up the hinterland of the two countries was constructed by Chinese company Sinohydro Tianji Engineering Corporation Ltd.
Méféré Mohamed, a Cameroonian who moved to Sangha 14 years ago, commenting of the development said: “in the past years everything came from Cameroon: nutrition, clothing, textiles in general and not forgetting beer.
“Everything that is agro-food came out of Cameroon for Congo. Today, with the completion of this road, I believe that we will consume both Congo and Cameroon products here in Souanké. I mean products that come from Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire and others that come from Douala and Yaoundé.”
After Gabon in 2014, Cameroon is the second country in the sub-region connected to Congo by an asphalt road.

DRC: Cobalt, Copper, cross-border transport nightmare

                        Democratic Republic Of Congo
The heavy load of copper cathodes is secured, the Howo semi-trailer is ready to travel the 2,000 km or so from the mines in Haut-Katanga to the port of Dar es Salaam, from where the cargo will be shipped to Asia.
""It can take two weeks to make the trip,"" complains Omar Rachidi Katema, a 57-year-old Tanzanian truck driver who has just loaded 27 tons of copper plate at the Chemaf (Chemicals of Africa) plant at the Etoile mine site in Lubumbashi, in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
""There are a lot of traffic jams, a lot of tolls, a lot of waiting at the border,"" says the trucker.
The plates (cathodes) are firmly attached in bundles, each weighing 2.3 tons. ""To avoid theft"" during transport, explains Eric Tshinkobo, copper manager at the plant.
At the London Metal Exchange (LME) price, a ton of copper costs about $10,000.
But if the goods are spared, the drivers are not, especially on the Congolese portion of the route. ""Thieves attack us, especially on the Lubumbashi bypass road,"" says Omar Rachidi.
""Between here and the Zambian border (about 80 km), bandits attack us, rip off the tarpaulins, take away our money,"" also laments Jacob Daoudi, 45, another Tanzanian trucker, who transports 30 tons of cobalt hydroxide in his Scania.
- Ten times more expensive -
To avoid drivers carrying too much cash, operators are increasingly resorting to prepayment, via a bank, of the substantial sums to be paid at the toll booths along the road from Kolwezi, another major mining town in neighbouring Lualaba province, to Kasumbalesa, on the border with Zambia.
There are six toll booths along the 400 km of this strategic route,"" said Lambert Tshisueka Mutondo, president of the international road transporters of Haut-Katanga, affiliated with the Federation of Congolese Companies (FEC). This situation ""hinders the flow of traffic and the profitability of the sector"", he says.
He also deplores the tariffs charged: to cover these 400 km, heavy goods vehicles pay some 500 dollars, or 1,000 dollars round trip, ten times more expensive on average, according to him, than on the roads of southern Africa.
The tolls on this section are conceded by the Congolese state to a Chinese company which, in return, undertakes to ensure the construction and maintenance of road infrastructure.
The issue is sensitive and regularly debated, with one NGO recently denouncing the ""leonine"" nature of this type of contract. The Congolese Association for Access to Justice (Acaj) was surprised that after 14 years of concessions, the DRC still does not have a highway.
The government firmly disputes this analysis and asserts that these concessions, which it wants to extend, have enabled the construction and rehabilitation of many roads.
- Racket -
Compared to the average state of the Congolese road network, National Road 1, which crosses ""greater Katanga"", is good, paved and without deep potholes. But it has only two lanes, one for each direction of traffic.
Upstream of the Kanyaka tollbooth, halfway between Lubumbashi and the border, more than 200 semi-trailers are at a standstill, waiting to complete the mandatory formalities.
""In the Congo, there are red tape all the time,"" says Maniasi Djuma Makweba, 50, also on his way to Dar es Salaam with 35 tons of cobalt loaded at TFM (Tenke Fungurume Mining), 300 km away.
Like the other drivers, he complains about thieves, but also about the military and police. ""When you go to the police to report a theft, they start by trying to extort money from you,"" the trucker says.
The Upper Katanga transporters' guild is calling for ""patrols to deter criminals"", as well as for the number of toll booths to be halved, for prices to be ""capped according to the distance to be covered"" and ""harmonized"" between the DRC and neighboring Zambia.
In fact, ""by reciprocity"", Zambia makes Congolese trucks pay a high price when crossing its territory and thus loses all competitiveness to South African, Zimbabwean or Tanzanian transporters. ""For several years, international transport in our province has been the prerogative of foreign companies,"" deplores its president.
The DRC is the world's largest producer of cobalt and Africa's largest producer of copper.

                        Algeria
China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the ""best guarantee of development"", stressing that ""our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km."" The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
""China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner,"" said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
""The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth,"" he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
""As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities,"" said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
""This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone,"" echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

                        Rwanda
Rwanda is investing heavily in sports through partnerships with clubs such as Arsenal and PSG and the organization of the World Road Cycling Championships in 2025. However this strategy has drawn criticism from the opposition, which doubts it is usefull for the economy of the 73rd FIFA Congress host country.
First, it was a multi-million dollar sponsorship of English Premier League club Arsenal in 2018, followed by a splashy deal to back French giants Paris Saint-Germain a year later. The ""Visit Rwanda"" can now be seen on Premier League and Ligue 1 pitches.
The vision of Rwandan authorities takes shape with club sponsorships and hosting duties for events ranging from 2021’s Basketball Africa league tournament to cycling’s Road World Championships in 2025.
It has required extensive work to provide the country with new sports infrastructure: $104 million for a 10,000-seat basketball hall, $16 million for a golf course inaugurated in 2021 in Kigali, and $165 million budgeted for the ongoing construction of the National Stadium, which is expected to expand from 25,000 to 45,000 seats by 2024.
President Paul Kagame has spent a small fortune on sports investments that he says will burnish the international image and diversify the economy of the tiny eastern African country.
But the splurge has drawn accusations of “sports-washing”. Campaigners accuse Kagame of crushing political dissent and stifling free speech during his more than 22 years in power.
Improve standard of living""These investments do not meet the immediate needs of the vast majority of Rwandans,"" said opposition politician Victoire Ingabire, a fierce critic of Kagame.
""I don’t believe there is return for his investments,"" she told AFP, saying that the sponsorships did little to help rural Rwandans. ""It is wasted money.""
In the eastern African ccountry, per capita income is estimated at just $822 according to 2021 World Bank figures.
Government officials have defended the projects, arguing that they serve to bolster the country’s reputation as a safe destination for high-profile events.
Pre-pandemic tourism revenues jumped 17 percent to $498 million in 2019, according to Rwanda Development Board.
The board’s CEO, Clare Akamanzi, said at the weekend that the Arsenal and PSG sponsorship deals alone had generated over $160 million in media value. This had in turn brought one million visitors to Rwanda, injecting $445 million in tourism revenues, she added.
""These guests not only left Rwanda with positive memories; they also played a direct role in improving peoples’ lives,"" she wrote in an opinion piece published Saturday in the East African newspaper.
Fearless""It’s alright to disagree with Rwanda’s governance model, but a campaign to undermine investment in a developing country’s economy, which has a real impact on the lives (of) people, is counterproductive and cynical,"" she adde.
For Kagame — an ardent Arsenal supporter — the deals had surpassed ""by far what we invested"", he said this month, adding that the government was on the verge of sponsoring a third team.
And world football’s governing body FIFA will be in town this week for its 73rd congress to reelect its chief Gianni Infantino who is running unopposed.
Authorities say such events bring in much-needed foreign exchange and provide an economic boost to the landlocked nation which is reliant on tourism.
Ruling party MP John-Ruku Rwabyoma echoed her sentiments in an interview with AFP, charging that critics of the deal were ""ignorant"" and that the government was acting in the best interest of its people.
""We are not here to satisfy critics based on their agenda. Where were all these critics when Rwanda was suffering?""
A foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity told AFP he was skeptical about the claims.
""I don’t know whether it is cost-effective… whether it is paying off in the long run, maybe then, but now, I do not think so,"" he said, adding that he had not seen the numbers to support the government’s narrative.
Nonetheless, doubts raised by ""pundits who mostly know next to nothing about Rwanda, and draw upon tired tropes"" will do little to stop the initiatives, according to Clare Akamanzi.
""We will not be bullied into ceding our place at the table,"" she said.

Corruption inflated costs of high-profile projects in Zambia - IMF

                        Zambia
The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday (Jan. 10) that corruption had inflated the cost of numerous high-profile tenders and infrastructure projects in Zambia.
At the request of local authorities, an IMF interdepartmental Governance Diagnostic Assessment mission conducted last year a study focused on governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities.
The assessment revealed serious weakness across all state functions. However, those with particular macroeconomic impact were found in areas including public financial management, granting and managing contracts in the mining sector.
""For instance, enormous financial resources invested in infrastructure projects, such as road construction, provided avenues for corruption, especially in the award of tenders, where political connections allowed members of the elite to bend the rules and access to lucrative contracts"", the 96-page report read.
The IMF diagnostic says corruption became particularly institutionalized during 2016-2021 period.
Zambia's current leader vowed, upon his election two years ago, to show ""zero tolerance"" for graft.
Hakainde Hichilema's first targets were members of the government of his predecessor.
Many arrests however ended in bail, with defendants denying the charges.

                        Ivory Coast
Ivory Coast on Monday commissioned the construction of two major infrastructure projects in the Ivorian economic capital Abidjan- that of a metro and the extension of the international airport. The launch of the construction was attended by the French Economy Minister Bruno le Maire who signed agreements  including credit, for this project.
""The purpose of my visit is obviously to mark the concrete launch of the completion of major infrastructure projects here in Abidjan. "" Le Maire said in Abidjan.
""The metro is one of the largest infrastructure projects on the continent. It is an ambitious project, a social project that will benefit millions of people in Abidjan"" the French minister added.
At the end of 2019, a French consortium comprising the groups Bouygues Travaux Publics, Alstom, Colas Rail and Keolis had been chosen to build the first metro line in Abidjan.
At the time, France committed to cover the contract with a mix of loans from the French Treasury and private financing guaranteed by the French government. The cost of the work is estimated at 1.36 billion euros. The line will cross the Ivorian metropolis from north to south over 37 km, as far as the airport. The construction work has been delayed for years, but the government hopes that the metro will be operational by 2025.

                        Nigeria
The China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) on Monday handed over Nigeria's first deep sea port to the government after the completion of the huge maritime project in the country's economic hub city of Lagos. 
The completion ceremony of Lekki port which took place at the Lekki Area Site in Lagos State brought together dignitaries and stakeholders from Nigeria and China as well as their international partners. 
In his address, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwolu expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government for its support of Nigeria's infrastructure, and praised Chinese enterprises for completing the project construction efficiently and on schedule. 
""The benefit of this project and the benefits to our citizens can be left better imagined, providing jobs for close to 200,000 people with direct and indirect jobs in the next couple of months ahead. 
In addition, we can see the figure adding tens of billions in dollar revenue to our country and to our state and to the host community in taxes and revenue,"" said Babajide Sanwo-Olu, state governor of Lagos.
 Constructed by the CHEC, the Lekki Deep Sea Port is the largest seaport in Nigeria, and one of the biggest in West Africa. The construction of the port commenced in June 2020, and is designed to handle 1.2 million standard containers annually. 
As a commercial project of tripartite cooperation between China, France and Nigeria, Lekki port is of great significance for promoting Belt and Road cooperation in Africa, said the ambassador. 
""The French side has their experience, shipping routes and cargo volume, then our Chinese side has the construction, use, and maintenance of this port, plus Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa. We are very optimistic,"" said Wu Di, deputy general manager of China Harbor Engineering Company. 
China's Ambassador to Nigeria Cui Jianchun said Lekki port and the Lekki Free Trade Zone could work together to spur economic development. 
""This is very, very important for Lagos State and also it is very important that I categorize here the deep sea port as a gateway for Nigeria. So Nigeria now through this maritime road can build with the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. I think that is very, very critical for Nigerian commodities to go to the international market,"" said Cui. The new port has two container berths, which can berth the world's largest Panamax cargo ship.

                        Kenya
Kenyan president William Ruto is seeking an additional $1 billion in loans from China despite Kenya's public debt having reached $70 billion.
President Ruto was was one of a number of global leaders in Beijing to attend the tenth anniversary meeting of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the ambitious plan that aims to connect Africa, Asia and Europe through massive infrastructure and energy projects.
The BRI has seen the development of several infrastructure projects in Kenya, including the Standard Gauge Railway line, which runs from the port city of Mombasa to the Rift Valley via the capital, Nairobi.
Costing $4.7 billion dollars to build, it has faced numerous challenges, including delays and a low uptake of its freight service.
The SGR which started operations in 2017, was initially intended to go all the way to neighbouring Uganda to the west, as well as serving other landlocked countries in eastern and Central Africa.
However, Uganda pulled out and opted instead for partnership with a Turkish firm for the construction of its main line.
The line was mainly constructed using Chinese banks loans and last week.
Kenya currently owes China $6 billion, according to national data. 
Karuti Kanyinga, a research professor at the Institute for Development Studies at the University of Nairobi, said Kenya's ""largest creditor today is China.""
""We are paying through the nose and most of our earnings are actually going to paying Chinese loans and that is not going to be sustainable,"" he said.
With many of its Chinese loans set to mature in the current fiscal year, Ruto has taken measures to reduce government spending, including asking all ministries to reduce their budgets by more than 10%.
Critics, however, say he has reneged on his promises by continuing to borrow heavily.

Kenya: Sand harvestings' dire impact on rivers and aquatic life

It's hard to believe that a river flowed through this land in Kenya's Machakos County.
It's just over a hundred miles from the capital Nairobi with its demands as a growing city.
Construction, the need to make glass, cement, concrete and a host of everyday items is what leads the workers and their lorries here.
But the constant excavation of sand n is threatening the environment.
These teams of sand excavators say they are aware of the problem, but there is no system to help them manage the harvesting sustainably.
John Mutisya collects and sells sand in Kenya.
He says he and others have seen the devastation caused by uncontrolled sand harvesting.
""For our sand, sometimes we excavate to the detriment of our grazing areas, leading to our animals lacking water, but if the government can construct sand catchments so that we can have watering and grazing areas, put regulations where we are supposed to pass while carrying sand and restrict others and construct good roads, it will be a good move,"" says Mutisya.
""The sand carried from these rivers in a day is in hundreds and thousands of tons because an average semi-trailer can carry 50 tons, (but) there are those for 30 tons and one like mine which is 15 tons. So in a day, it's hard to know the exact (amount) but it's thousands of tons,"" he adds.
Halinish Yusuf is the Sand Conservation and Utilization Director at Makueni County.
She believes there is a clear need to regulate the industry and to carry out studies to discover whether the resources they have in terms of sand can meet the growing demands.
""Because of the strategic importance of sand being the second most extracted natural resource after water and the importance because of the modernization that is going on, demand from the construction industry, demand from the glass industry and many other industries, there is a need to start thinking about regulating it, recycling, regulating where its harvested, how its harvested, but also thinking about alternatives and also thinking about upscaling and monitoring how its harvested, where, the amounts we have so that we start planning for the future,"" says Yusuf.
In Kiambu County, a new construction site requires more building materials.
The groundbreaking ceremony to mark a new housing project is cause for celebration, but it could have detrimental consequences for the environment from which the sand is being excavated.
Many rivers in this part of Kenya are bare, and only huge protruding rocks remain.
Lorries excavating sand runs on almost a 24-hour cycle to supply building sites like this one in Kiambu.
Site engineer Samuel Waweru of Vimika Construction has to turn this 20-acre site into a block of residential apartments in the next 18 months.
He argues the regulation of sand supply is a government issue, but he says his crews will also be able to use the rocks to make the necessary building materials.
""About the river sand we don't have data on how much sand is being used but it is in huge figures in terms of millions of tons. In the future because of the environment, we have seen some counties prohibit sand harvesting but in case of sand is prohibited, we have an alternative where we can use rock sand. Rock sand we get it from the ballast, when we are crushing the ballast the byproduct is rock sand which is recommended to use as a substitute for river sand,"" he says.
According to a recent report by the United Nations Environment Programe (UNEP) sand is the second-largest exploited resource after water.
It says globally, 50 billion tons of sand and gravel are harvested every year.
The conservation group WWF says: ""sand mining is already putting unprecedented pressure on rivers, floodplains and deltas,"" leading to erosion, biodiversity loss and reduced protection from storm surges.
Many communities in Kenya depend on this sort of excavation as their only source of income and as a consequence in some regions, uncontrolled harvesting has led to environmental damage which has been largely overlooked.
According to Yusuf, there needs to be an inventory to understand how much sand is left, what damage has been done and what the demands of the industry will be in the coming years.
She says: ""Unfortunately, there is no data to show how much sand is going to be demanded in future development, and by the same token there is hardly any research on the amount of sand deposits that we have. And so, there is, even as we make plans, development plans as governments, we are not able to tell how much sand will be required and if we are running into a crisis or not and so, there is a need to invest in research, to know how much sand deposits we have, how much can be harvested, and how much is needed for development.""
Mutisya is aware that his livelihood is already going to have an impact on the supply of water to his family because as the sand disappears and the ground heads underground water supplies are depleted.
He says: ""We are saying if the government puts in structures, we will be ready to comply with those restrictions because in doing so we will conserve water for our livestock and even for our own consumption, so that there is a restricted area so that we can conserve the water because we are headed to a very dry season where we will be forced to buy water, even for our livestock.""

                        Senegal
Senegal and the French group Meridiam, which specialises in the financing and development of infrastructure, announced on Monday that they had signed a contract for the acquisition and management of electric buses in Dakar.
the initiative aims at reducing congestion in this West African metropolis.
The BRT (bus rapid transfer) project, on which work is underway, aims to provide Dakar with electric rapid buses from 2023 onwards, running on exclusive lanes between the suburbs and the city centre, over a distance of more than 18 km, a stretch where traffic is slowed down because of traffic jams.
The investment for the electric buses amounts to 127 billion FCFA (193.6 million euros), according to the Senegalese authorities. The total cost of the BRT project is more than 300 billion FCFA (€450 million) financed by donors such as the World Bank.
Senegal signed the contract with Meridiam and a consortium made up of the French state-owned companies SNCF and RATP, the French transport operator Kéolis and Fonsis, a Senegalese investment fund, said on Monday a statement from the Executive Council for Urban Transport in Dakar (Cetud), a body attached to the Senegalese Transport Ministry.
The 15-year concession contract covers ""the acquisition, operation and maintenance of rolling stock and BRT systems"". Meridiam announced ""the provision of a fleet of 100% electric buses, with batteries, including an initial fleet of 121"", in a separate press release. This is a concrete project in favour of energy transition that offers a solution adapted to the challenge of climate change, but also an effective alternative to the existing diesel bus network"", it said.
The BRT project also includes the construction of workshops and depots, more than 80 km of roads and pavements to be developed or rehabilitated along the axes served, including intersections, bus stops and terminals. It complements the regional express train (TER) running between Dakar and its suburbs, the first section of which was inaugurated in December.
The two transport systems, BRT and TER, which complement each other with feeder lines, aim to relieve congestion in Dakar, where 0.3% of Senegal's 17 million people live and almost all of the country's economic activities are concentrated. Traffic jams officially cost the city 152 million euros per year.

                        Nigeria
Four Nigerian soldiers and two civilians were killed and two South Korean employees kidnapped by gunmen who ambushed them in southern Nigeria, the police announced on Wednesday.
The attack took place on Tuesday morning on a road in Rivers State.
Kidnappings for ransom are common in Nigeria, where criminal groups sometimes target foreigners, particularly those working in mines and construction sites far from urban areas.
""The assailants ambushed a convoy of vehicles carrying two Daewoo workers at around 9:30 am. Four soldiers escorting the Koreans and their two civilian drivers were killed in the attack,"" a senior state police official told AFP.
""The gunmen also kidnapped the two Koreans before fleeing,"" also taking the soldiers' weapons with them, added the officer, who did not wish to be named.
Rivers State Police spokeswoman Grace Iringe Koko confirmed the attack. ""We are investigating the matter and will give details later,"" she told AFP.
Contacted by AFP, the army and the Deawoo company were not immediately available to comment on the attack.
Several Asian companies, notably Chinese and South Korean, operate in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, where they are involved in road and rail construction projects.
Foreign workers kidnapped in Nigeria in the past have often been released after paying ransom to their captors.

                        Nigeria
Four Nigerian soldiers and two civilians were killed and two South Korean employees kidnapped by gunmen who ambushed them in southern Nigeria, the police announced on Wednesday.
The attack took place on Tuesday morning on a road in Rivers State.
Kidnappings for ransom are common in Nigeria, where criminal groups sometimes target foreigners, particularly those working in mines and construction sites far from urban areas.
""The assailants ambushed a convoy of vehicles carrying two Daewoo workers at around 9:30 am. Four soldiers escorting the Koreans and their two civilian drivers were killed in the attack,"" a senior state police official told AFP.
""The gunmen also kidnapped the two Koreans before fleeing,"" also taking the soldiers' weapons with them, added the officer, who did not wish to be named.
Rivers State Police spokeswoman Grace Iringe Koko confirmed the attack. ""We are investigating the matter and will give details later,"" she told AFP.
Contacted by AFP, the army and the Deawoo company were not immediately available to comment on the attack.
Several Asian companies, notably Chinese and South Korean, operate in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, where they are involved in road and rail construction projects.
Foreign workers kidnapped in Nigeria in the past have often been released after paying ransom to their captors.

DRC: Turkish builders “ faster than the Chinese”

                        Democratic Republic Of Congo
The people of Kinshasa cannot believe the speed at which a Turkish company has built an imposing financial complex in the heart of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, more accustomed to major Chinese projects than to these new builders of the African continent.
“It’s changed suddenly,” notes a street vendor with a laugh, who has been forced for a little over a year to move his goods as the perimeter of the construction site changes. “They work day and night, even faster than the Chinese,” adds a security agent, somewhat admiringly.
In February 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an official visit to the DRC, his umpteenth trip to Africa. Under his leadership, Ankara has invested a lot in the continent over the past two decades, to develop diplomatic but also economic ties.
Turkish companies have, for example, built a mosque in Ghana, stadiums in Rwanda or Senegal, and airports in several countries.
Cooperation
In Kinshasa, he concluded cooperation agreements concerning in particular security, defense and the construction of infrastructure, including the ""Finance Center"" whose work was quickly launched, in a concession located near the Turkish school, in the business commune of Gombe.
There was at this place, between the courthouse and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a roundabout pompously called Place de l'Independance, decorated with a sort of faded cement platform carried by stairs leading to no monument.
Visitors sometimes walked there, between the rows of plants in small bags bought by the occupants of the villas with gardens built in the area during the time of the Belgian settlers. Then the palisades and construction bungalows appeared, quickly dominated by half a dozen concrete towers gradually covered with glass panels.
Two of them, around twenty floors high, will house the Ministries of Finance and Budget. The complex, which includes nine buildings in total, will also house a convention center, offices, a large hotel, etc.
Milvest
The prime contractor is the company Milvest, a subsidiary of the Turkish holding company Miller. According to its CEO Turhan Mildon, who gave a press briefing on the site in mid-September, this project will have employed some 3,000 people - 1,800 Congolese and 1,200 Turks.
The cost of the work is estimated at $290 million, pre-financed by the company, which is also investing $60 million in the hotel which it will manage for 49 years. The finance center is scheduled to be inaugurated on December 2. Before the elections scheduled for the 20th of the same month, in which the current president Félix Tshisekedi is a candidate for a second term.
With its dusty scaffolding, the construction site very close to the new Chinese embassy seems almost to be stalling, and the Chinese workers no longer have the attraction of novelty among the Congolese.
Very present in the country since the time of Mobutu Sese Seko (1965-97), they built the ""People's Palace"" , the seat of Parliament, and the Martyrs Stadium, an immense enclosure with 80,000 seats.
Under Joseph Kabila (2001-2019), under the terms of a mega-contract ""mines for infrastructure"", they rebuilt and enlarged large avenues, including the boulevard du 30 Juin, which looks like a highway in the middle of the city. Under Félix Tshisekedi, they continue to build, among other things, a gigantic cultural complex currently nearing completion.
Renovation
But against them, Turkey is advancing its pawns. In addition to the financial center, the Milvest company is in the running for the renovation and extension of Kinshasa airport, a project initially awarded to a Chinese company but not completed.
The construction of an urban cable car is also planned in an outlying, hilly, and congested area of ​​Kinshasa, for which Milvest is in contract with the French company Poma, a cable transport specialist.
This project, still in its administrative phase, particularly intrigues the inhabitants of Kinshasa, a chaotic city of 15 million souls where electricity and running water are rare commodities in certain neighborhoods.

                        Democratic Republic Of Congo
The people of Kinshasa cannot believe the speed at which a Turkish company has built an imposing financial complex in the heart of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, more accustomed to major Chinese projects than to these new builders of the African continent.
“It’s changed suddenly,” notes a street vendor with a laugh, who has been forced for a little over a year to move his goods as the perimeter of the construction site changes. “They work day and night, even faster than the Chinese,” adds a security agent, somewhat admiringly.
In February 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an official visit to the DRC, his umpteenth trip to Africa. Under his leadership, Ankara has invested a lot in the continent over the past two decades, to develop diplomatic but also economic ties.
Turkish companies have, for example, built a mosque in Ghana, stadiums in Rwanda or Senegal, and airports in several countries.

In Kinshasa, he concluded cooperation agreements concerning in particular security, defense and the construction of infrastructure, including the ""Finance Center"" whose work was quickly launched, in a concession located near the Turkish school, in the business commune of Gombe.
There was at this place, between the courthouse and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a roundabout pompously called Place de l'Independance, decorated with a sort of faded cement platform carried by stairs leading to no monument.
Visitors sometimes walked there, between the rows of plants in small bags bought by the occupants of the villas with gardens built in the area during the time of the Belgian settlers. Then the palisades and construction bungalows appeared, quickly dominated by half a dozen concrete towers gradually covered with glass panels.
Two of them, around twenty floors high, will house the Ministries of Finance and Budget. The complex, which includes nine buildings in total, will also house a convention center, offices, a large hotel, etc.
Milvest
The prime contractor is the company Milvest, a subsidiary of the Turkish holding company Miller. According to its CEO Turhan Mildon, who gave a press briefing on the site in mid-September, this project will have employed some 3,000 people - 1,800 Congolese and 1,200 Turks.
The cost of the work is estimated at $290 million, pre-financed by the company, which is also investing $60 million in the hotel which it will manage for 49 years. The finance center is scheduled to be inaugurated on December 2. Before the elections scheduled for the 20th of the same month, in which the current president Félix Tshisekedi is a candidate for a second term.
With its dusty scaffolding, the construction site very close to the new Chinese embassy seems almost to be stalling, and the Chinese workers no longer have the attraction of novelty among the Congolese.
Very present in the country since the time of Mobutu Sese Seko (1965-97), they built the ""People's Palace"" , the seat of Parliament, and the Martyrs Stadium, an immense enclosure with 80,000 seats.
Under Joseph Kabila (2001-2019), under the terms of a mega-contract ""mines for infrastructure"", they rebuilt and enlarged large avenues, including the boulevard du 30 Juin, which looks like a highway in the middle of the city. Under Félix Tshisekedi, they continue to build, among other things, a gigantic cultural complex currently nearing completion.
Renovation
But against them, Turkey is advancing its pawns. In addition to the financial center, the Milvest company is in the running for the renovation and extension of Kinshasa airport, a project initially awarded to a Chinese company but not completed.
The construction of an urban cable car is also planned in an outlying, hilly, and congested area of ​​Kinshasa, for which Milvest is in contract with the French company Poma, a cable transport specialist.
This project, still in its administrative phase, particularly intrigues the inhabitants of Kinshasa, a chaotic city of 15 million souls where electricity and running water are rare commodities in certain neighborhoods.

 Gabon: Report slams record of Ali Bongo's second term

                        Gabon
A report titled ""105 promises, 13 achievements"" takes a closer look at the second 7-year term of Gabonese president Ali Bongo.
Economists Mays Mouissi et Harold Leckat assess in a 196-page-long document the efficiency of the Bongo administration. And the results do not live up to promises.
In a country of less than 2.5 millions inhabitants, with gas, mineral and oil deposits, the unemployment rate rose.  
""Generally speaking, most of the infrastructure projects promised by the President have not been carried out,"" Mays Mouissi notes.
""I'm speaking about the road projects, the 5 hydroelectric dams, schools, the digital knowledge city he promised, the 700 nurseries and so on...""
""If we want to look at it from a macro-economic perspective, the unemployment rate has risen from 28% to 32%; as for poverty, a third, 35% of Gabonese people live below the poverty line, that is to say on less than two dollars a day, and access to basic social services has totally disintegrated.""
The report also notes that 30% of civil servant positions have been allocated to women, bills passed to improve port activity, including the construction of a commercial port and an ore port in Owendo, as well as the preservation of territorial waters. 
But much still needs to be done. Mays Mouissi says the health condition of the president shouldn't be used as an excuse. Ali Bongo suffered a stroke in 2018.
""I think we have to be clear, we mustn't hide behind the President's stroke to justify this failure, because the reality is that, had the President felt unable to govern after his stroke, he would have resigned; if he remained in charge, it was because he felt able to govern,"" Mouissy considers.
""We've taken into account the fact that there was Covid, and we talk about that in the report. But let us be serious, in many African countries, we can follow the progress of major project, to name only one country, I can mention a well known example, that of Côte d'Ivoire. It shows that we are faced with a problem of governance, leadership, and governmental stability in the management of these projects.
The report's authors hope their initiative will raise public awareness ahead of the August 26 presidential polls. 
President Ali Bongo and his fiercest rival Jean Ping are expected to go again head-to-head.

 Gabon: Report slams record of Ali Bongo's second term
                                                      Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba arrives at celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of UNESCO,  at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, Friday Nov. 12, 2021.
                                                                                    -

                        Gabon
A report titled ""105 promises, 13 achievements"" takes a closer look at the second 7-year term of Gabonese president Ali Bongo.
Economists Mays Mouissi et Harold Leckat assess in a 196-page-long document the efficiency of the Bongo administration. And the results do not live up to promises.
In a country of less than 2.5 millions inhabitants, with gas, mineral and oil deposits, the unemployment rate rose.  
""Generally speaking, most of the infrastructure projects promised by the President have not been carried out,"" Mays Mouissi notes.
""I'm speaking about the road projects, the 5 hydroelectric dams, schools, the digital knowledge city he promised, the 700 nurseries and so on...""
""If we want to look at it from a macro-economic perspective, the unemployment rate has risen from 28% to 32%; as for poverty, a third, 35% of Gabonese people live below the poverty line, that is to say on less than two dollars a day, and access to basic social services has totally disintegrated.""
The report also notes that 30% of civil servant positions have been allocated to women, bills passed to improve port activity, including the construction of a commercial port and an ore port in Owendo, as well as the preservation of territorial waters. 
But much still needs to be done. Mays Mouissi says the health condition of the president shouldn't be used as an excuse. Ali Bongo suffered a stroke in 2018.
""I think we have to be clear, we mustn't hide behind the President's stroke to justify this failure, because the reality is that, had the President felt unable to govern after his stroke, he would have resigned; if he remained in charge, it was because he felt able to govern,"" Mouissy considers.
""We've taken into account the fact that there was Covid, and we talk about that in the report. But let us be serious, in many African countries, we can follow the progress of major project, to name only one country, I can mention a well known example, that of Côte d'Ivoire. It shows that we are faced with a problem of governance, leadership, and governmental stability in the management of these projects.
The report's authors hope their initiative will raise public awareness ahead of the August 26 presidential polls. 
President Ali Bongo and his fiercest rival Jean Ping are expected to go again head-to-head.

                        Ivory Coast
From all four corners of the city, it is impossible to miss it: the immense dome of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro is the symbol of the excessiveness of this city, which is nevertheless struggling to establish itself, at the dawn of its 40th year, as the true capital of Côte d'Ivoire.
With its wide avenues, its large wooded areas, its 1970s architecture and its fluid road traffic, Yamoussoukro, in the peaceful center of Côte d'Ivoire, is unlike any other city in the country.
It is the fruit of a dream, that of the first president of independent Côte d'Ivoire, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, to make his native village of N'Gokro the capital of his country. This was done on March 21, 1983.
Over the course of the 20th century, the village became a real city and inherited a name in homage to Yamousso, the Baule queen and great-aunt of ""FHB"".
""Félix Houphouët-Boigny first wanted to correct the colonial legacy we had received to stop everything being concentrated in one city (Abidjan),"" Jean-Noël Loucou, secretary general of the Félix Houphouët Boigny Foundation, a research institute on peace issues, explained to AFP.
""In creating this capital, the idea was to show the African genius with a particular architecture, without big buildings with a lot of green spaces,"" he adds.
Forty years later, the city is very large and has some 300,000 inhabitants. But still very few institutions.
The heart of Ivorian politics still beats in the coastal south, in Abidjan, with only the Senate and the National Chamber of Traditional Kings and Chiefs having moved away.
- Political incantations -
However, there has been no lack of political incantations since the death of the founding father in 1993.
Laurent Gbagbo, president from 2000 to 2011, even launched major construction projects to build a National Assembly and a presidential palace. But the two sites are now abandoned, overgrown with vegetation.
""The will to transfer the capital to Yamoussoukro exists. It is the means that are lacking. As a local authority, we do not have the means to go into international debt, so we are obliged to choose profitable financing that will generate money. But I am hopeful that this will happen one day,"" the region's governor, Augustin Thiam, told AFP.
""Yamoussoukro is not yet in fact the capital of Côte d'Ivoire. But it is out of the question to create a capital from scratch. There are many things to evaluate, quantify, before moving on to the realization,"" he adds from the gardens of the residence of President Houphouët, his great uncle.
For the time being, Yamoussoukro remains one of the country's main tourist attractions, thanks in particular to its basilica, inspired by that of St. Peter's in Rome and which is the highest Catholic religious building in the world at 158 meters high.
The Caiman Lake, which borders Houphouët's imposing residence, also attracts the curious who observe the dozens of lizards that bask on the banks, right in the center of town.
- ""Crossroads"" of the country -
""Houphouët tried to build Yamoussoukro little by little around three pillars, education with great schools, religion with the basilica, and tourism. The position of the city is strategic, it is a great crossroads in the center of the country. Everyone passes through here,"" says Nanan Kouassi Konan, chief of the neighboring village of Kami, one of the ""cradles"" of the former president.
The saturation and tumult of Abidjan with its 6 million inhabitants could also push more and more Ivorians to go back to Yamoussoukro.
Serge Pokou, a hotelier and farmer, took the step a few years ago with his family.
""I naturally opted for the calm of Yamoussoukro, which is a mix of modern city and countryside, steeped in a preserved African culture. The geometry of the main roads, the lush green spaces, the surprising buildings maintain the calm, the charm and the splendor of the city"", he appreciates.
It also remains to build a real economic fabric around the capital beyond tourism. The future creation of an industrial zone is hopeful in this respect.
""We expect economic benefits because the capital must live, so we need activities. The major schools in Yamoussoukro are having trouble retaining their engineers and technicians because there is no industry here,"" says Jean-Noël Loucou.
""But we must be careful to safeguard the identity of the city and its tranquility, which remain, above all, the criterion of choice for those who live there or who seek to settle there,"" warns Serge Pokou.

Ivory Coast: The city of Yamoussoukro in its 40th year as capital

                        Ivory Coast
From all four corners of the city, it is impossible to miss it: the immense dome of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro is the symbol of the excessiveness of this city, which is nevertheless struggling to establish itself, at the dawn of its 40th year, as the true capital of Côte d'Ivoire.
With its wide avenues, its large wooded areas, its 1970s architecture and its fluid road traffic, Yamoussoukro, in the peaceful center of Côte d'Ivoire, is unlike any other city in the country.
It is the fruit of a dream, that of the first president of independent Côte d'Ivoire, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, to make his native village of N'Gokro the capital of his country. This was done on March 21, 1983.
Over the course of the 20th century, the village became a real city and inherited a name in homage to Yamousso, the Baule queen and great-aunt of ""FHB"".
""Félix Houphouët-Boigny first wanted to correct the colonial legacy we had received to stop everything being concentrated in one city (Abidjan),"" Jean-Noël Loucou, secretary general of the Félix Houphouët Boigny Foundation, a research institute on peace issues, explained to AFP.
""In creating this capital, the idea was to show the African genius with a particular architecture, without big buildings with a lot of green spaces,"" he adds.
Forty years later, the city is very large and has some 300,000 inhabitants. But still very few institutions.
The heart of Ivorian politics still beats in the coastal south, in Abidjan, with only the Senate and the National Chamber of Traditional Kings and Chiefs having moved away.
- Political incantations -
However, there has been no lack of political incantations since the death of the founding father in 1993.
Laurent Gbagbo, president from 2000 to 2011, even launched major construction projects to build a National Assembly and a presidential palace. But the two sites are now abandoned, overgrown with vegetation.
""The will to transfer the capital to Yamoussoukro exists. It is the means that are lacking. As a local authority, we do not have the means to go into international debt, so we are obliged to choose profitable financing that will generate money. But I am hopeful that this will happen one day,"" the region's governor, Augustin Thiam, told AFP.
""Yamoussoukro is not yet in fact the capital of Côte d'Ivoire. But it is out of the question to create a capital from scratch. There are many things to evaluate, quantify, before moving on to the realization,"" he adds from the gardens of the residence of President Houphouët, his great uncle.
For the time being, Yamoussoukro remains one of the country's main tourist attractions, thanks in particular to its basilica, inspired by that of St. Peter's in Rome and which is the highest Catholic religious building in the world at 158 meters high.
The Caiman Lake, which borders Houphouët's imposing residence, also attracts the curious who observe the dozens of lizards that bask on the banks, right in the center of town.

""Houphouët tried to build Yamoussoukro little by little around three pillars, education with great schools, religion with the basilica, and tourism. The position of the city is strategic, it is a great crossroads in the center of the country. Everyone passes through here,"" says Nanan Kouassi Konan, chief of the neighboring village of Kami, one of the ""cradles"" of the former president.
The saturation and tumult of Abidjan with its 6 million inhabitants could also push more and more Ivorians to go back to Yamoussoukro.
Serge Pokou, a hotelier and farmer, took the step a few years ago with his family.
""I naturally opted for the calm of Yamoussoukro, which is a mix of modern city and countryside, steeped in a preserved African culture. The geometry of the main roads, the lush green spaces, the surprising buildings maintain the calm, the charm and the splendor of the city"", he appreciates.
It also remains to build a real economic fabric around the capital beyond tourism. The future creation of an industrial zone is hopeful in this respect.
""We expect economic benefits because the capital must live, so we need activities. The major schools in Yamoussoukro are having trouble retaining their engineers and technicians because there is no industry here,"" says Jean-Noël Loucou.
""But we must be careful to safeguard the identity of the city and its tranquility, which remain, above all, the criterion of choice for those who live there or who seek to settle there,"" warns Serge Pokou.

                        Burkina Faso
Tunisian director Youssef Chebbi won the coveted Stallion of Yennenga award Saturday (Mar. 4) at the biennial pan-African Fespaco film festival for his murder mystery oeuvre ""Ashkal"".
Tunis-born Chebbi, whose film centres on the investigation into the killing of a caretaker on a construction site at Carthage on the outskirts of his hometown, did not attend the ceremony in Burkina Faso, presided over by military leader Ibrahim Traore.
Chebbi won out over Burkinabe rival Apolline Traore, who picked up a consolation Silver Stallion award for ""Sira"", while the bronze went to Kenya's Angela Wamai for ""Shimoni"".
The Stallion of Yennenga (Etalon d'or de Yennenga) is awarded for the fictional or documentary feature film judged best to depict African realities.
A total of 170 entries have been selected for the FESPACO festival in the capital Ouagadougou, including 15 fiction feature films in contention for the Yennenga Golden Stallion award and a prize of around $30,000.
The president of FESPACO's organising committee, Fidele Aymar Tamini, said the festival's 28th edition would embrace the theme of ""African cinemas and peace cultures"" in the context of the crisis.
The prime minister of neighbouring Mali, the festival's guest country of honour which is also grappling with a bloody jihadist insurgency, said culture had an ""avant-garde role to play in the peace process"".
Mali and Burkina Faso are ""brother countries"" facing the ""terrorist hydra"" and ""our fight for peace and sovereignty remains the priority,"" Choguel Kokalla Maiga said to rapturous applause.
Showcase young Burkinabe's braveryAround 60 dancers simulated fighting to the sound of beating drums on an immense stage in a performance called ""20 million VDP"", referring to a civilian volunteer force that supports the Burkinabe army.
The ceremony's organiser said the choreography was designed to showcase the ""bravery"" of Burkina Faso's youth faced with the jihadist crisis, which spilled over from Mali in 2015.
Around 12 VDP members were killed in an attack in the unstable north earlier this week, which followed the deaths of at least 70 soldiers in the same region in two separate assaults blamed on jihadists.
The violence in Burkina Faso has killed more than 10,000 people and forced around two million to flee their homes.
Burkinabe Culture and Communications Minister Jean-Emmanuel Ouedraogo said Mali and Burkina Faso, both ruled by military juntas that seized power in coups, were travelling on the same road in integration and cooperation projects.
Prime Minister Apollinaire Kyelem de Tambela recently suggested a federation between the West African neighbours.

                        Burkina Faso
Tunisian director Youssef Chebbi won the coveted Stallion of Yennenga award Saturday (Mar. 4) at the biennial pan-African Fespaco film festival for his murder mystery oeuvre ""Ashkal"".
Tunis-born Chebbi, whose film centres on the investigation into the killing of a caretaker on a construction site at Carthage on the outskirts of his hometown, did not attend the ceremony in Burkina Faso, presided over by military leader Ibrahim Traore.
Chebbi won out over Burkinabe rival Apolline Traore, who picked up a consolation Silver Stallion award for ""Sira"", while the bronze went to Kenya's Angela Wamai for ""Shimoni"".
The Stallion of Yennenga (Etalon d'or de Yennenga) is awarded for the fictional or documentary feature film judged best to depict African realities.
A total of 170 entries have been selected for the FESPACO festival in the capital Ouagadougou, including 15 fiction feature films in contention for the Yennenga Golden Stallion award and a prize of around $30,000.
The president of FESPACO's organising committee, Fidele Aymar Tamini, said the festival's 28th edition would embrace the theme of ""African cinemas and peace cultures"" in the context of the crisis.
The prime minister of neighbouring Mali, the festival's guest country of honour which is also grappling with a bloody jihadist insurgency, said culture had an ""avant-garde role to play in the peace process"".
Mali and Burkina Faso are ""brother countries"" facing the ""terrorist hydra"" and ""our fight for peace and sovereignty remains the priority,"" Choguel Kokalla Maiga said to rapturous applause.
Showcase young Burkinabe's braveryAround 60 dancers simulated fighting to the sound of beating drums on an immense stage in a performance called ""20 million VDP"", referring to a civilian volunteer force that supports the Burkinabe army.
The ceremony's organiser said the choreography was designed to showcase the ""bravery"" of Burkina Faso's youth faced with the jihadist crisis, which spilled over from Mali in 2015.
Around 12 VDP members were killed in an attack in the unstable north earlier this week, which followed the deaths of at least 70 soldiers in the same region in two separate assaults blamed on jihadists.
The violence in Burkina Faso has killed more than 10,000 people and forced around two million to flee their homes.
Burkinabe Culture and Communications Minister Jean-Emmanuel Ouedraogo said Mali and Burkina Faso, both ruled by military juntas that seized power in coups, were travelling on the same road in integration and cooperation projects.
Prime Minister Apollinaire Kyelem de Tambela recently suggested a federation between the West African neighbours.

China’s chief diplomat was in Cairo Sunday for talks with Egyptian and Arab League officials, marking his last stop in a multi-leg trip to Africa that aims to consolidate Beijing's footprint across the resource-rich continent. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang met with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry.
As well as meeting separately with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit. In a joint news conference, Shoukry said the talks addressed Sino-Egyptian relations and increasing Chinese tourism to the Middle Eastern country, which has for years struggled to revive its vital tourism sector.
Both ministers said they also discussed regional issues including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Tensions have risen after the return to office last month of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is heading Israel’s most right-wing and religiously conservative government.
He also called for “maintaining the status quo” at Jerusalem’s most important holy site, after an ultranationalist Israeli Cabinet minister visited it earlier this year. That visit drew fierce condemnation from across the Muslim world and a strong rebuke from the United States.
In his meeting with el-Sissi, the Chinese foreign minister said Beijing would continue to develop its investment in Egypt’s infrastructure projects including those with links to China’s Belt and Road initiative.
China has invested billions of dollars in Egyptian state-led projects such as the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the new administrative capital, which is being built east of Cairo. Qin arrived in Cairo Saturday afternoon.
His weeklong trip included Ethiopia, where the African Union headquarters is located, as well as Gabon, Angola and Benin. It was Qin's first overseas trip since his appointment in December.
For more than three decades, China’s foreign ministers have started their terms by visiting Africa, whose growing population as a continent rivals China’s.
Beijing has invested heavily in infrastructure in African countries, including roads, energy infrastructure, telecommunications, railways, and hospitals. The Chinese financial groups and funds also gave out $160 billion (USD) in loans to Africa between 2000 and 2020, according to the Chinese Loans to Africa Database.
Amide the coronavirus pandemic, China raced to provide vaccines to Africa, which received only 1% of global COVID-19 vaccine supplies.
China also funded the construction of a new headquarters for the African Center for Disease Control in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa.

China’s chief diplomat was in Cairo Sunday for talks with Egyptian and Arab League officials, marking his last stop in a multi-leg trip to Africa that aims to consolidate Beijing's footprint across the resource-rich continent. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang met with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry.
As well as meeting separately with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit. In a joint news conference, Shoukry said the talks addressed Sino-Egyptian relations and increasing Chinese tourism to the Middle Eastern country, which has for years struggled to revive its vital tourism sector.
Both ministers said they also discussed regional issues including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Tensions have risen after the return to office last month of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is heading Israel’s most right-wing and religiously conservative government.
He also called for “maintaining the status quo” at Jerusalem’s most important holy site, after an ultranationalist Israeli Cabinet minister visited it earlier this year. That visit drew fierce condemnation from across the Muslim world and a strong rebuke from the United States.
In his meeting with el-Sissi, the Chinese foreign minister said Beijing would continue to develop its investment in Egypt’s infrastructure projects including those with links to China’s Belt and Road initiative.
China has invested billions of dollars in Egyptian state-led projects such as the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the new administrative capital, which is being built east of Cairo. Qin arrived in Cairo Saturday afternoon.
His weeklong trip included Ethiopia, where the African Union headquarters is located, as well as Gabon, Angola and Benin. It was Qin's first overseas trip since his appointment in December.
For more than three decades, China’s foreign ministers have started their terms by visiting Africa, whose growing population as a continent rivals China’s.
Beijing has invested heavily in infrastructure in African countries, including roads, energy infrastructure, telecommunications, railways, and hospitals. The Chinese financial groups and funds also gave out $160 billion (USD) in loans to Africa between 2000 and 2020, according to the Chinese Loans to Africa Database.
Amide the coronavirus pandemic, China raced to provide vaccines to Africa, which received only 1% of global COVID-19 vaccine supplies.
China also funded the construction of a new headquarters for the African Center for Disease Control in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa.

                        Egypt
The UN climate panel (IPCC) has already written the worst-case scenario: in 2050, ""the sea will rise by one meter"". Then it will swallow ""a third of the ultra-fertile land of the Nile Delta and historic cities like Alexandria will be flooded"".
Every year, the city of Alexander the Great sinks by three millimeters, weakened by the Nile dams upstream that prevent silt from consolidating its soil and by offshore gas drilling.
Opposite, the sea is rising as much, due to the effect of warming and the melting of the ice cap.
Hundreds of people have already had to leave buildings weakened by floods, in 2015 and in 2020. They are only the first of many, warns the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources.
In the Nile Delta, the sea has advanced 3 km inland since the 1960s. In the 1980s, the Rosetta lighthouse, built by Khedive Ismail at the very end of the 19th century, was engulfed by the waves.
""Climate change is now a reality and no longer just a warning,"" says the head of the Egyptian Coastal Protection Authority Ahmed Abdelqader.
Climate change in the Mediterranean will be one of the most radical in the world because its deep waters will warm more than all the oceans, warns the IPCC.
In a best-case scenario, if the Mediterranean rises only 50 centimeters, as other Egyptian and UN studies estimate, ""30% of Alexandria will be flooded, 1.5 million or more people will be displaced, 195,000 jobs will be destroyed, and losses in land and construction will reach $30 trillion.""
The disaster will have repercussions on the 104 million Egyptians because ""in addition to its history and its vestiges of the past, Alexandria is also home to the largest port in the country"", the nerve centre of the Egyptian economy, recalls Mr. Abdelqader. Abdelqader.
Alexandria has gained almost two million inhabitants in the last ten years and in the country, strangled by inflation and devaluation, investment in public infrastructure has not followed.
The city's governor, Mohammed al-Sherif, recently explained that ""the road drainage system was built to absorb one million cubic meters of rainfall, but now sometimes 18 cubic meters fall in a single day.
Not to mention the extreme weather events - temperature increases, rare rainfall, unprecedented snow events - that Alexandrians face.
""We have never seen such heat in Alexandria at the end of October,"" exclaims Mohammed Omar, 36. 
26 degrees, or five degrees more than the seasonal norm, while the rain is overdue.
Today, the city that keeps its cosmopolitan golden age of the early twentieth century art-deco cafes and Haussmann buildings can not cope. It didn't take more than Boris Johnson, the former British Prime Minister, to bid Alexandria ""farewell"" at COP26 last year in Glasgow, in a speech that chilled Egyptians' blood.
""Yes, the danger exists and we do not deny it, but we are launching projects to mitigate it,"" said Abdelqader.
To protect people and land, a belt of reeds has been planted along 69 kilometers of coastline.
""The sand aggregates around it and together they form a natural barrier,"" he explains. Soon, devices for warning and measuring waves will be put in place.
The heritage is also in danger. The citadel of Qaitbay, built in the fifteenth century on a narrow strip of land beaten by ever higher waves, is in the front line.
To protect this Mamluk fortress built on the site of the Alexandria lighthouse that disappeared in antiquity, 5,000 concrete blocks were installed to break the waves and support the building. Other blocks mitigate the damage all along the cornice.
Alexandria, with its long history of construction and destruction, does not want to see its heritage vanish.
There was its lighthouse, the largest library in the world, a temple of knowledge ravaged by fire... Today, its modest heir, an immense architect's building on the cornice, like the rest of the city, must be saved, pleads Mr. Abdelqader.
For this, ""the West has a moral responsibility: it must help to counter the negative effects of climate change, which is the result of its choices of civilization.
The COP27, which will open on November 6 in Egypt, will be there to remind us of this.

Egypt: Alexandria expected to sink by 2100

                        Egypt
The UN climate panel (IPCC) has already written the worst-case scenario: in 2050, ""the sea will rise by one meter"". Then it will swallow ""a third of the ultra-fertile land of the Nile Delta and historic cities like Alexandria will be flooded"".
Every year, the city of Alexander the Great sinks by three millimeters, weakened by the Nile dams upstream that prevent silt from consolidating its soil and by offshore gas drilling.
Opposite, the sea is rising as much, due to the effect of warming and the melting of the ice cap.
Hundreds of people have already had to leave buildings weakened by floods, in 2015 and in 2020. They are only the first of many, warns the Egyptian Ministry of Water Resources.
In the Nile Delta, the sea has advanced 3 km inland since the 1960s. In the 1980s, the Rosetta lighthouse, built by Khedive Ismail at the very end of the 19th century, was engulfed by the waves.
""Climate change is now a reality and no longer just a warning,"" says the head of the Egyptian Coastal Protection Authority Ahmed Abdelqader.
Climate change in the Mediterranean will be one of the most radical in the world because its deep waters will warm more than all the oceans, warns the IPCC.
In a best-case scenario, if the Mediterranean rises only 50 centimeters, as other Egyptian and UN studies estimate, ""30% of Alexandria will be flooded, 1.5 million or more people will be displaced, 195,000 jobs will be destroyed, and losses in land and construction will reach $30 trillion.""
The disaster will have repercussions on the 104 million Egyptians because ""in addition to its history and its vestiges of the past, Alexandria is also home to the largest port in the country"", the nerve centre of the Egyptian economy, recalls Mr. Abdelqader. Abdelqader.
Alexandria has gained almost two million inhabitants in the last ten years and in the country, strangled by inflation and devaluation, investment in public infrastructure has not followed.
The city's governor, Mohammed al-Sherif, recently explained that ""the road drainage system was built to absorb one million cubic meters of rainfall, but now sometimes 18 cubic meters fall in a single day.
Not to mention the extreme weather events - temperature increases, rare rainfall, unprecedented snow events - that Alexandrians face.
""We have never seen such heat in Alexandria at the end of October,"" exclaims Mohammed Omar, 36. 
26 degrees, or five degrees more than the seasonal norm, while the rain is overdue.
Today, the city that keeps its cosmopolitan golden age of the early twentieth century art-deco cafes and Haussmann buildings can not cope. It didn't take more than Boris Johnson, the former British Prime Minister, to bid Alexandria ""farewell"" at COP26 last year in Glasgow, in a speech that chilled Egyptians' blood.
""Yes, the danger exists and we do not deny it, but we are launching projects to mitigate it,"" said Abdelqader.
To protect people and land, a belt of reeds has been planted along 69 kilometers of coastline.
""The sand aggregates around it and together they form a natural barrier,"" he explains. Soon, devices for warning and measuring waves will be put in place.
The heritage is also in danger. The citadel of Qaitbay, built in the fifteenth century on a narrow strip of land beaten by ever higher waves, is in the front line.
To protect this Mamluk fortress built on the site of the Alexandria lighthouse that disappeared in antiquity, 5,000 concrete blocks were installed to break the waves and support the building. Other blocks mitigate the damage all along the cornice.
Alexandria, with its long history of construction and destruction, does not want to see its heritage vanish.
There was its lighthouse, the largest library in the world, a temple of knowledge ravaged by fire... Today, its modest heir, an immense architect's building on the cornice, like the rest of the city, must be saved, pleads Mr. Abdelqader.
For this, ""the West has a moral responsibility: it must help to counter the negative effects of climate change, which is the result of its choices of civilization.
The COP27, which will open on November 6 in Egypt, will be there to remind us of this.

Ethiopia asks UN to rebuild infrastructure in Tigray

The Ethiopian government on Tuesday commissioned a UN agency to rebuild some of the destroyed infrastructure in Tigray, a region in conflict with Addis Ababa and controlled by rebel authorities, as part of a project funded by the World Bank (WB).
The WB awarded a $300 million grant to Ethiopia in April, funding a project to help conflict-affected communities in the country.
The project aims to rebuild infrastructure destroyed by the conflict and improve access to basic services and make it easier for victims of gender-based violence to access assistance programmes.

An agreement with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) calls for the UN agency to ""implement the activities defined by the first objective of the project in the Tigray region,"" the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance said in a statement Tuesday.
It will in particular ""rebuild infrastructure providing essential services affected by the conflict"".
""Unops will implement the project in Tigray until the situation in Tigray improves and allows the government to implement the project through its own structures,"" the statement said.
The second objective of the project ""will be implemented by another third party"" about which negotiations are underway, the ministry said.
Several of Ethiopia's international partners have suspended their aid since the start in November 2020 of a conflict between the federal government and rebels in Tigray, marked by numerous abuses and which has led to a serious humanitarian crisis in the north of the country.  
In April, the WB became the first major financial institution to release funds to Ethiopia since the war began. Some observers saw a link with the announcement a few days earlier of a ""humanitarian truce"" in Tigray.
Since the truce, fighting has stopped in Tigray and the federal government has allowed desperately needed humanitarian aid to be delivered by road again after a three-month hiatus.
But the region remains without most basic services - electricity, telecommunications, banking - and several of Ethiopia's partners continue to press for their restoration.
At the end of June, the WB provided an additional $715 million in loans and grants to Ethiopia to help pastoralist communities - affected by conflict and unprecedented drought - cope with food insecurity.
A few days earlier, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said for the first time that he was open to negotiations with the Tigray rebels, who regained control of most of the region in 2021.

                        Ethiopia
The Ethiopian government on Tuesday commissioned a UN agency to rebuild some of the destroyed infrastructure in Tigray, a region in conflict with Addis Ababa and controlled by rebel authorities, as part of a project funded by the World Bank (WB).
The WB awarded a $300 million grant to Ethiopia in April, funding a project to help conflict-affected communities in the country.
The project aims to rebuild infrastructure destroyed by the conflict and improve access to basic services and make it easier for victims of gender-based violence to access assistance programmes.

An agreement with the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) calls for the UN agency to ""implement the activities defined by the first objective of the project in the Tigray region,"" the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance said in a statement Tuesday.
It will in particular ""rebuild infrastructure providing essential services affected by the conflict"".
""Unops will implement the project in Tigray until the situation in Tigray improves and allows the government to implement the project through its own structures,"" the statement said.
The second objective of the project ""will be implemented by another third party"" about which negotiations are underway, the ministry said.
Several of Ethiopia's international partners have suspended their aid since the start in November 2020 of a conflict between the federal government and rebels in Tigray, marked by numerous abuses and which has led to a serious humanitarian crisis in the north of the country.  
In April, the WB became the first major financial institution to release funds to Ethiopia since the war began. Some observers saw a link with the announcement a few days earlier of a ""humanitarian truce"" in Tigray.
Since the truce, fighting has stopped in Tigray and the federal government has allowed desperately needed humanitarian aid to be delivered by road again after a three-month hiatus.
But the region remains without most basic services - electricity, telecommunications, banking - and several of Ethiopia's partners continue to press for their restoration.
At the end of June, the WB provided an additional $715 million in loans and grants to Ethiopia to help pastoralist communities - affected by conflict and unprecedented drought - cope with food insecurity.
A few days earlier, Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said for the first time that he was open to negotiations with the Tigray rebels, who regained control of most of the region in 2021.

                        Ivory Coast
In the Ivorian capital, one person in five lives in flood-prone areas. It is not just Climate change to blame.
In Abidjan, people build in risky areas such as wetlands. Drainage pipes are blocked and channels are used as dumping grounds, leaving even the slightest of downpours to turn into flash floods.
""The city was built with concrete and bitumen. The water struggles to drain through,"" said Yao Konan, an urban planner.
The city lacks proper drainage infrastructure by the rains have also become heavier in recent years, a phenomenon attributed to climate change.
Road construction without proper drainage planning has been blamed for flooding neighborhoods of the capital.
In June, 19 people lost their lives, and 5 were injured. Forecasters say the coming days look less grim.  
The months of June and July are the wettest in the south of Ivory Coast with heavy rainfall. 
The Africa Cup of Nations which had been scheduled for June 2023 has been moved to January 2024.

                        Ivory Coast
In the Ivorian capital, one person in five lives in flood-prone areas. It is not just Climate change to blame.
In Abidjan, people build in risky areas such as wetlands. Drainage pipes are blocked and channels are used as dumping grounds, leaving even the slightest of downpours to turn into flash floods.
""The city was built with concrete and bitumen. The water struggles to drain through,"" said Yao Konan, an urban planner.
The city lacks proper drainage infrastructure by the rains have also become heavier in recent years, a phenomenon attributed to climate change.
Road construction without proper drainage planning has been blamed for flooding neighborhoods of the capital.
In June, 19 people lost their lives, and 5 were injured. Forecasters say the coming days look less grim.  
The months of June and July are the wettest in the south of Ivory Coast with heavy rainfall. 
The Africa Cup of Nations which had been scheduled for June 2023 has been moved to January 2024.

Sub-saharan African migrant workers fill gaps in Tunisian labour market

                        Tunisia
Many Sub-saharan African workers in Tunisia have said expressed happiness to find employment. Kui Kadi is one such economic migrant. He arrived in Tunis at the beginning of 2018.
""Job opportunities are not available to everyone, I came from Ivory Coast, almost a year ago and thank God I could find work here at the gas station"" Kadi says.
There are plenty of cars and trucks stopping by to fill-up along a main road in the heart of Tunis. Customers are plenty and in times when Tunisia is facing a shortage of workers, many from sub-Saharan Africa are stepping in to fill the gap.
Taloo Kadi also works at a petrol station. ""Before I came here they told me that Tunisia is a difficult country. But I'm very respected by the owner of the station and earn my living, life is good,"" she says.
Migrants are often recruited for jobs in construction, cafes and restaurants in Tunisia. But as many came illegally, they don't benefit from employment rights leaving some unscrupulous employers to exploit that vulnerability.
Petrol station owner Jilani Ben Rhouma says workers just want to be treated fairly.
""It is not unusual for Tunisians not to pay what they owe to African workers,"" he says.
These workers are not asking for extra money but only for the work they do. ""If they agree with someone on a certain amount, they will not ask you to add more and do not want to be paid less than what they agreed on.""
Conditions of entry to Tunisia are very strict. Illegal migrants can be expelled and penalties can be imposed on Tunisians if they harbour foreigners illegally.
All foreigners entering Tunisia are subject to a law dating back to 1968. The law provides a number of conditions for employment in the north African country and for obtaining temporary or permanent residence permits.
For Valentin Bonnefoy, who works for the Tunisian Economic and Social Forum, Tunisian law is not fit for purpose. ""Tunisian law does not protect sub-Saharan African workers or foreigners in general,"" he says.
""Tunisia must work on the enactment of a new immigration law, and it is working on it. This law gives a new image of Tunisia after the dictatorship.""
For now, African workers continue to fill in the gap of Tunisian labour market and hope the law can give them full protection from exploitation.

                        Tunisia
Many Sub-saharan African workers in Tunisia have said expressed happiness to find employment. Kui Kadi is one such economic migrant. He arrived in Tunis at the beginning of 2018.
""Job opportunities are not available to everyone, I came from Ivory Coast, almost a year ago and thank God I could find work here at the gas station"" Kadi says.
There are plenty of cars and trucks stopping by to fill-up along a main road in the heart of Tunis. Customers are plenty and in times when Tunisia is facing a shortage of workers, many from sub-Saharan Africa are stepping in to fill the gap.
Taloo Kadi also works at a petrol station. ""Before I came here they told me that Tunisia is a difficult country. But I'm very respected by the owner of the station and earn my living, life is good,"" she says.
Migrants are often recruited for jobs in construction, cafes and restaurants in Tunisia. But as many came illegally, they don't benefit from employment rights leaving some unscrupulous employers to exploit that vulnerability.
Petrol station owner Jilani Ben Rhouma says workers just want to be treated fairly.
""It is not unusual for Tunisians not to pay what they owe to African workers,"" he says.
These workers are not asking for extra money but only for the work they do. ""If they agree with someone on a certain amount, they will not ask you to add more and do not want to be paid less than what they agreed on.""
Conditions of entry to Tunisia are very strict. Illegal migrants can be expelled and penalties can be imposed on Tunisians if they harbour foreigners illegally.
All foreigners entering Tunisia are subject to a law dating back to 1968. The law provides a number of conditions for employment in the north African country and for obtaining temporary or permanent residence permits.
For Valentin Bonnefoy, who works for the Tunisian Economic and Social Forum, Tunisian law is not fit for purpose. ""Tunisian law does not protect sub-Saharan African workers or foreigners in general,"" he says.
""Tunisia must work on the enactment of a new immigration law, and it is working on it. This law gives a new image of Tunisia after the dictatorship.""
For now, African workers continue to fill in the gap of Tunisian labour market and hope the law can give them full protection from exploitation.

Plastic pollution clogs hydropower dam in DR Congo

                        Democratic Republic Of Congo
At the southern end of the majestic Lake Kivu, bordered by green hills, a compact sheet of plastic waste is constantly forming, to the point of blocking the turbines of the largest hydroelectric plant in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
The Ruzizi dam attracts like a magnet the thousands of bottles, cans and other garbage thrown into the lake, which stretches some 90 km along the border between the DRC and Rwanda.
""As the lake flows towards the Ruzizi River, little by little all the waste that is thrown in comes to rest here,"" Liévin Chizungu, head of production at the Ruzizi 1 power station, explained to a team from AFP. Even the waste coming from Goma, to the north of the lake.
The mountainous terrain and rainy climate of the city of Bukavu do not help. ""The rainwater carries the waste into the lake and then into the river,"" explains engineer Jovy Mulemangabo, who is responsible for South Kivu at the national electricity company (Snel).
According to Mr. Chizungu, this waste is piling up in the installations ""at a depth of 14 meters"". Divers have to clean the bottom of the river to prevent the turbines from being clogged and the towns in the region from being deprived of electricity, he added.
Byunanine Mubalama, on the other hand, clears as best he can on the surface, by boat. ""I've been doing this job for 13 years... Every day there is garbage that I have to clean up,"" he says.
But nothing works. Since the end of January, one of the four units of the power plant, damaged by the waste, has been shut down.
""The impact is enormous, we have a deficit of 6.3 megawatts out of a total of 30 MW that we have to produce, not only for the province of South Kivu, but also for the neighboring province of North Kivu and nearby Burundi,"" says the production manager.
With a generator failure at the Ruzizi 2 power plant, about 25 km south of Bukavu, also caused by waste, a total of 20 MW is missing from the distribution network, the provincial head of Snel also said.
This leads to ""a lot of load shedding in the towns of Bukavu and Uvira"", he regrets.
- Raising awareness, cleaning up -
What can be done to remedy the problem? ""First of all, raise awareness among the population, tell them that the lake is not the right place to throw away waste"", nor ""the gullies that end up pouring into it"", suggests Liévin Chizungu. The authorities must crack down, according to him, by taking sanctions against ""people who throw garbage into the lake"".
""Our houses are stuck together on small plots of land, there is no way to manage household waste and I have no choice but to throw it into the Kawa River, which overlooks the lake,"" said Mathilde Binja, a housewife living near the lake.
Malgache Malyanga, head of the Bukavu Household Waste Management Program (PGDM), says that his organization, among others, ""collects and disposes of the city's waste"" for $3 to $5 per month per household.
But ""is it for lack of means? Or by ignorance? Many inhabitants prefer to throw their garbage on the road at night or in the lake, for those who live near it"".
Nicole Menemene, 29 years old, collects plastic waste on the shore of the lake to make ""baskets, flowerpots, garbage cans, stools, pedestal tables... "".
At the head of a private company, Plastycor, and a team of ten people, she is in charge of the valorization of this waste, transformed into ""useful and beautiful"" objects.
""The work is done by hand"", but the ideal would be ""to industrialize what we do"", underlines the head of the company, who would like to contribute to ""a 90% reduction of the pollution of Lake Kivu"".

Plastic pollution clogs hydropower dam in DR Congo

                        Democratic Republic Of Congo
At the southern end of the majestic Lake Kivu, bordered by green hills, a compact sheet of plastic waste is constantly forming, to the point of blocking the turbines of the largest hydroelectric plant in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
The Ruzizi dam attracts like a magnet the thousands of bottles, cans and other garbage thrown into the lake, which stretches some 90 km along the border between the DRC and Rwanda.
""As the lake flows towards the Ruzizi River, little by little all the waste that is thrown in comes to rest here,"" Liévin Chizungu, head of production at the Ruzizi 1 power station, explained to a team from AFP. Even the waste coming from Goma, to the north of the lake.

According to Mr. Chizungu, this waste is piling up in the installations ""at a depth of 14 meters"". Divers have to clean the bottom of the river to prevent the turbines from being clogged and the towns in the region from being deprived of electricity, he added.

""The impact is enormous, we have a deficit of 6.3 megawatts out of a total of 30 MW that we have to produce, not only for the province of South Kivu, but also for the neighboring province of North Kivu and nearby Burundi,"" says the production manager.
With a generator failure at the Ruzizi 2 power plant, about 25 km south of Bukavu, also caused by waste, a total of 20 MW is missing from the distribution network, the provincial head of Snel also said.
This leads to ""a lot of load shedding in the towns of Bukavu and Uvira"", he regrets.

The authorities must crack down, according to him, by taking sanctions against ""people who throw garbage into the lake"".
""Our houses are stuck together on small plots of land, there is no way to manage household waste and I have no choice but to throw it into the Kawa River, which overlooks the lake,"" said Mathilde Binja, a housewife living near the lake.
Malgache Malyanga, head of the Bukavu Household Waste Management Program (PGDM), says that his organization, among others, ""collects and disposes of the city's waste"" for $3 to $5 per month per household.
But ""is it for lack of means? Or by ignorance? Many inhabitants prefer to throw their garbage on the road at night or in the lake, for those who live near it"".
Nicole Menemene, 29 years old, collects plastic waste on the shore of the lake to make ""baskets, flowerpots, garbage cans, stools, pedestal tables... "".
At the head of a private company, Plastycor, and a team of ten people, she is in charge of the valorization of this waste, transformed into ""useful and beautiful"" objects.
""The work is done by hand"", but the ideal would be ""to industrialize what we do"", underlines the head of the company, who would like to contribute to ""a 90% reduction of the pollution of Lake Kivu"".

                        Cameroon
Eight people were killed and dozens more injured in a crush outside a Cameroonian football stadium ahead of an Africa Cup of Nations match, officials said Tuesday.
Cameroonian President Paul Biya ordered an investigation into the tragedy that occurred Monday as crowds attempted to enter the Olembe Stadium in the capital Yaounde to watch the host nation play the Comoros.
Although crowds at the 60,000-seat stadium had been limited to 60 percent of capacity for the tournament because of the coronavirus pandemic, the cap is raised to 80 percent when Cameroon's Indomitable Lions play.
""Eight deaths were recorded, two women in their 30s, four men in their 30s, one child, one body taken away by the family,"" according to a preliminary health ministry report.
The ministry said victims were ""immediately transported"" in ambulances, but ""heavy road traffic slowed down the transport"".
Communications Minister Rene Emmanuel Sadi said 38 people were injured, including seven seriously, according to a statement.
The health ministry reported earlier that around 50 were hurt, including two people with multiple injuries and two more with serious head wounds.
A baby was also reportedly trampled by the crowd, the ministry added. The infant was ""immediately extracted and taken to Yaounde General Hospital"" and is in a ""medically stable"" condition, it added.
The tragedy happened at gates where final ticket checks are supposed to take place.
One man in his 30s who was caught up in the crush that it was ""complete chaos"" at the entrance to the stadium as supporters without tickets tried to force their way in.
""I arrived a quarter of an hour before kick-off. I had my ticket, but all of a sudden a group of people without tickets arrived and tried to force their way through and we found ourselves pushed up against the fences,"" said the supporter, who gave his name as Stephane.
""I was crushed up against a woman who said she couldn't breathe. Eventually the gate gave in and I was able to get through, but it was complete chaos.""
- 'Crisis meeting' -
President Biya has ""ordered the opening of an investigation so that all light is shed on this tragic incident,"" the communications minister said.
The Confederation of African Football (CAF), which runs the continent's flagship competition, said it was ""investigating the situation and trying to get more details on what transpired"".
It added it was in ""constant communication with Cameroon government and the Local Organizing Committee"".
Cameroon's health minister Manaouda Malachie tweeted images showing him visiting a hospital treating those injured in the incident.
""Everything is done to give them free care and the best support,"" he tweeted.
CAF was due to hold a ""crisis meeting"" with the organising committee on Tuesday, dedicated exclusively to security issues in the stadiums, a source close to African football's governing body said.
- Deadly crowding -
The government, Sadi said, is ""once more appealing to Cameroonians' sense of responsibility, discipline and civic duty for the total success of this great sporting event.""
Cameroon was initially meant to host the Cup of Nations in 2019, but the event was moved to Egypt over concerns the country's stadiums were not ready.
CAF cited delays in the construction of stadiums and infrastructure projects, as well as question marks over security.
Overcrowding at football matches around the world has resulted in scores of deaths.
Thousands of fans in the Egyptian capital Cairo in 2015 attempted to enter a stadium to watch a game, triggering panic as police fired tear gas and birdshot, resulting in 19 dead.
In April 2001, 43 people died in a stampede at Johannesburg's Ellis Park stadium during a game between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs.
In chaotic scenes at last year's European Championship final between England and Italy in London, some 2,000 ticketless fans were found to have gained access to Wembley Stadium, with an independent review later finding that a tragedy was only narrowly averted.
On the pitch on Monday, Cameroon sealed their place in the last eight of the tournament with a 2-1 win and will now play Gambia in the quarter-finals.
That match is due to be played on Saturday in Cameroon's economic capital Douala, although there had been speculation that remaining matches scheduled to be played there could be moved to Yaounde due to concerns about the state of the pitch.

                        Cameroon
Eight people were killed and dozens more injured in a crush outside a Cameroonian football stadium ahead of an Africa Cup of Nations match, officials said Tuesday.
Cameroonian President Paul Biya ordered an investigation into the tragedy that occurred Monday as crowds attempted to enter the Olembe Stadium in the capital Yaounde to watch the host nation play the Comoros.
Although crowds at the 60,000-seat stadium had been limited to 60 percent of capacity for the tournament because of the coronavirus pandemic, the cap is raised to 80 percent when Cameroon's Indomitable Lions play.
""Eight deaths were recorded, two women in their 30s, four men in their 30s, one child, one body taken away by the family,"" according to a preliminary health ministry report.
The ministry said victims were ""immediately transported"" in ambulances, but ""heavy road traffic slowed down the transport"".
Communications Minister Rene Emmanuel Sadi said 38 people were injured, including seven seriously, according to a statement.
The health ministry reported earlier that around 50 were hurt, including two people with multiple injuries and two more with serious head wounds.
A baby was also reportedly trampled by the crowd, the ministry added. The infant was ""immediately extracted and taken to Yaounde General Hospital"" and is in a ""medically stable"" condition, it added.
The tragedy happened at gates where final ticket checks are supposed to take place.
One man in his 30s who was caught up in the crush that it was ""complete chaos"" at the entrance to the stadium as supporters without tickets tried to force their way in.
""I arrived a quarter of an hour before kick-off. I had my ticket, but all of a sudden a group of people without tickets arrived and tried to force their way through and we found ourselves pushed up against the fences,"" said the supporter, who gave his name as Stephane.
""I was crushed up against a woman who said she couldn't breathe. Eventually the gate gave in and I was able to get through, but it was complete chaos.""
- 'Crisis meeting' -
President Biya has ""ordered the opening of an investigation so that all light is shed on this tragic incident,"" the communications minister said.
The Confederation of African Football (CAF), which runs the continent's flagship competition, said it was ""investigating the situation and trying to get more details on what transpired"".
It added it was in ""constant communication with Cameroon government and the Local Organizing Committee"".
Cameroon's health minister Manaouda Malachie tweeted images showing him visiting a hospital treating those injured in the incident.
""Everything is done to give them free care and the best support,"" he tweeted.
CAF was due to hold a ""crisis meeting"" with the organising committee on Tuesday, dedicated exclusively to security issues in the stadiums, a source close to African football's governing body said.
- Deadly crowding -
The government, Sadi said, is ""once more appealing to Cameroonians' sense of responsibility, discipline and civic duty for the total success of this great sporting event.""
Cameroon was initially meant to host the Cup of Nations in 2019, but the event was moved to Egypt over concerns the country's stadiums were not ready.
CAF cited delays in the construction of stadiums and infrastructure projects, as well as question marks over security.
Overcrowding at football matches around the world has resulted in scores of deaths.
Thousands of fans in the Egyptian capital Cairo in 2015 attempted to enter a stadium to watch a game, triggering panic as police fired tear gas and birdshot, resulting in 19 dead.
In April 2001, 43 people died in a stampede at Johannesburg's Ellis Park stadium during a game between Orlando Pirates and Kaizer Chiefs.
In chaotic scenes at last year's European Championship final between England and Italy in London, some 2,000 ticketless fans were found to have gained access to Wembley Stadium, with an independent review later finding that a tragedy was only narrowly averted.
On the pitch on Monday, Cameroon sealed their place in the last eight of the tournament with a 2-1 win and will now play Gambia in the quarter-finals.
That match is due to be played on Saturday in Cameroon's economic capital Douala, although there had been speculation that remaining matches scheduled to be played there could be moved to Yaounde due to concerns about the state of the pitch.

Africa's megacities are set back by a lack of modern infrastructure. From Lagos to Kinshasa, Luanda to Abidjan, the demand for bigger roads, metros, bus systems, and bridges far outweighs the investment.
The United Nations recommends that by 2030 countries implement solutions for sustainable urban growth whose mobility is more environmentally friendly. 
To achieve this goal, Angola intends to launch a surface metro for its capital, Luanda.
""[This is] a project of great contribution, to ensure, exactly, that both communities and cities healthier, and also, from the point of view of infrastructure, to bring innovation to our city by solving a major difficulty that is urban mobility,"" said transport minister Ricardo de Abreu in Luanda.
German transportation company Siemens Mobility will build the light rail under a Public-Private Partnership.   
It is estimated to cover a distance of 149 km at a cost of around 3.5 billion dollars.
Luanda, the capital of oil-rich Angola houses 8 million people. The figure is expected to surge to 12 million people by 2030.
The German government has pledged to help Siemens secure financing for the project. 
Luanda is one of Africa's biggest cities. And traffic gridlocks are common due to a lack of a modern public transportation system.

Gabon: Residence of Moanda town blame flagship project for unfulfilled pladges

                        Gabon
A flagship project of the Gabonese government to streamline the economy is now at the centre of controversy.
The Ogooué mineral company, also known as Comilog, which is today the world’s second largest producer of manganese, is being blamed for lack of steering development among the local community around.
Locals in and around Moanda town have pointed out vivid inequalities in terms of development compared to other regions in Gabon. They are now crying foul over lack of basic amenities.
""Here in Comilog's Route Noir, we have no electricity, we have no water, we have no public pumps, and we want to have water and electricity,"" a resident told AFP journalist.
In 2018, Comilog launched a corporate social responsibility plan aimed at developing the city's infrastructure, rehabilitation of schools, social security coverage and high-speed internet. In 2019, the company announced that it had spent 20 million dollars on these projects.
But the mayor of Moanda confirmed that the projects were not sufficiently funded and therefore did not solve the long term problems in the area.
""Participation efforts have only been going on for two, two and a half years. What has been done is good, but there is still a lot to be done. That means that there are still under-integrated neighbourhoods, that there are secondary roads that are in a lamentable state. Comilog knows this. We think that two years out of fifty or even more is not enough to judge,"" Bernard Moulonda, Mayor of Moanda said.
Gabon is now the world's second-largest producer of manganese. This ore is mainly used in the manufacture of steel, ceramics, batteries and electronic circuits, and even in the food industry. For example, producing a ton of steel requires 7 kg of manganese – and Comilog produces over 4 million tons of it every year.

Singer Akon's Senegalese 'Wakanda' city unstarted, locals left in dark

                        Music
A year after singer Akon laid the first stone of the $6 billion futuristic city he vowed to build for his native Senegal, the site remains grassland.
The stone itself sits at the bottom of a dirt track in a field; a small placard advertising the megaproject has fallen off it.
Construction of ""Akon City,"" a project due to feature ultramodern twisting skyscrapers, was already meant to have begun near the Atlantic Ocean village of Mbodiene.
But building work is yet to start, prompting residents who were hoping for jobs to wonder about its future.
""They laid the foundation stone with a lot of speeches and promises,"" said Jules Thiamane, a 35-year-old local who works in the tourism industry.
""Compared to everything that was announced, I don't think we have seen much yet.""
Akon -- a Senegalese-American singer-songwriter best known for his R&B hits such as ""Smack That"" -- launched his eponymous city in September 2020, to great fanfare and international media attention.
The city's otherworldly design is partly inspired by Wakanda, he said at the time, referring to the fictional African city of the ""Black Panther"" Marvel movie and comic series.
Akon City's planners also say it will be a ""beacon of innovation and human development"" that will boost industry in the West African state of Senegal.
A stadium, casino, luxury high-rise apartment complexes, and an education district that will ""accommodate the most prestigious universities in the world"" are also part of the plans.
- Sleepy hamlet -
The glittering vision is a far cry from the existing sleepy hamlet of Mbodiene, about 100 kilometres (60 miles) south of the capital, where pigs roll in the muck and donkeys amble along the road.
Locals interviewed by AFP said they knew little about Akon City, nor why construction had been delayed.
The ceremonial stone was laid on August 31 2020 and construction was scheduled to begin early this year.
A hospital, school, shopping mall, homes, police station, waste centre and solar power plant are supposed to be completed in 2023 -- and the whole city by 2030.
Speaking on an untarmacked road as horned cattle grazed behind him, 25-year-old student Ahmeth Deme wondered whether the project had been cancelled.
Badara Diakhate, the deputy mayor of the local commune, said he was unaware of the exact reason for the delay but that ""people want things to get going.""
He welcomed investment in the village and said that delays were common, especially given the pandemic.
- Disillusioned -
At $6 billion, the planned cost of Akon City is huge -- it is not much smaller than Senegal's overall 2020 budget of about $7.5 billion.
The pomp and size the project elicited scepticism in Senegal at first, where developers and politicians often tout the merits of pet building works.
About 40 percent of Senegal's 16 million people live below the poverty line, according to a World Bank metric.
A lack of clarity regarding Akon City's funding also raised questions.
Paul Martin, from the US-based firm KE International which won the Akon City construction contract, said that Kenyan entrepreneur Julius Mwale is the lead investor.
He added that he could not disclose information on other investors for confidentiality reasons, but said more than $4 billion in funding had been raised.
Construction of Akon City will start in October, Martin said, after a similar Mwale-funded city is completed in Kenya.
""The first 12 months incorporated planning, approvals, procurement and recruitment of sub-contractors,"" Martin said by email, referring to Akon City.
But tourism worker Thiamane said that he'd grown disillusioned, pointing to earlier failed development projects in Mbodiene.
""What is shared in the village at the moment is the beginning of disappointment,"" he said.
Akon's team, and the Senegalese state tourism agency SAPCO, which is managing the project on the government's behalf, did not respond to repeated solicitations by AFP for comment.
- 'Still have hope' -
Most Mbodiene residents cited the potential benefits of Akon City and said it could bring jobs.
""This is big for us,"" said Philomene Bamimba, who heads a local women's association.
David Seck Sene, president of the village youth association, admitted there was confusion around the delays but said: ""I still have hope. I don't see how a project like this could stop tomorrow.""
He, like other residents, is pushing for education and training so that villagers are not sidelined to labourers' roles in Akon City.
KE International's Paul Martin said the aim is to empower locals to fill high-skilled jobs, adding that training would start when construction does.
No one in Mbodiene interviewed by AFP was aware of these plans, however.

A road and rail bridge linking Botswana and Zambia was inaugurated on Monday -- marking the completion of a multi-million-dollar project aimed at easing congestion at border crossings throughout the southern African region.
The curved Kazungula bridge, which stretches for 923 metres (some 3,000 feet) over the Zambezi River, provides a long-needed alternative route for hauliers.
""This will lower the cost of doing business,"" Zambia's President Edgar Lungu said at the ribbon-cutting ceremony, anticipating ""an increase in trade and competitiveness, job creation, tourism and other positive ripple effects"".
Construction of the $259 million (213 million euro) project began in December 2014, co-funded by the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), regional governments and other grants.
Namibia and Zimbabwe joined the consortium in 2018.
The bridge will facilitate intra-regional freight transport by allowing trucks to bypass the notorious Beitbridge border post between Zimbabwe and South Africa, which is perennially congested, with vehicles spending hours and sometimes days queueing to cross.
At Monday's ceremony, Botswana's President Mokgweetsi Masisi said the bridge would ""open avenues for improved trade"".
And Zimbabwe's leader Emmerson Mnangagwa hailed what he called a ""milestone achievement"" for the region.
The current leader of the African Union and president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Felix Tshisekedi, also attended the event.

                        Sudan
As night falls in Sudan, villagers rush to pull over travellers with a friendly roadblock of hospitality celebrating Islam's holy fasting month of Ramadan, traditions enduring despite dire economic troubles.
Rugs are rolled out on the roadside verge in an impromptu al fresco dining room to celebrate iftar, the fast-breaking evening meal to mark the end of a baking hot day without either a mouthful of food or a drop to drink.
""This is a custom that our grandparents began,"" said Aboulmaali Mohamed Ibrahim, offering a meal in the village of Nuba, some 50 kilometres (30 miles) south of Sudan's capital Khartoum.
""They began inviting travellers for meals following the construction of this road in the 1960s.""
To fasting travellers, the meal is a much-welcomed break from their exhausting long trips on Sudan's often rutted roads.
But to residents living in villages along the road, it is part of upholding Sudan's long-held traditions of hospitality to strangers and, amid a tough economic crisis, proof that the important things in life must remain the same.
The call for the evening prayer announces the end of another fasting day.
A feast is provided. Parched travellers, struggling after a day in the sun without liquid, are firstly handed a cool and refreshing squeezed juice.
Jugs of the local speciality ""hilw-mor"", or ""bitter-sweet"", a drink spiced with ginger and cinnamon, is also poured into cups.
Then an array of traditional food ranging from porridge to plump dates is placed out for all to share.
While some villagers are laying out the food, others are still busy waving to stop cars and buses on the busy highway, encouraging people to stop and join.
Ibrahim, despite struggling with the meagre income he earns as a teacher, has insisted on sharing his iftar meal every day since Ramadan began on April 13.
""We just bring whatever we have to the iftar table, no matter how little it is,"" he said.
'Never worry'Sudan has been struggling since the April 2019 toppling of hardline president Omar al-Bashir, following protests against his rule triggered by economic hardship.
Severe shortages of food staples and price hikes remain among the pressing issues, two years after Bashir's fall, said Ibrahim.
Inflation last month shot up over 330 percent, the government said.
People now often queue for hours to buy basic foods or to fill their cars with petrol.
Households suffer from frequent power cuts, and gas canisters for cooking are often hard to find.
The transitional government, which came to power after Bashir's ouster, has embarked on painful reforms hoped to rebuild the economy.
In February, it introduced a managed float to the local currency in an attempt to close the yawning gap between the official and black-market rates.
Other bold measures include reducing costly subsidies on fuel and other commodities.
But others fear the measures risk fanning popular discontent before coming to fruition.
Mudather Saad, another villager from Nuba, says they typically host around 150-200 travellers to the iftar meals each evening -- but on busy nights even more.
""Our guests sometimes exceed 300 -- especially on weekends,"" said Saad, as he joined other villagers to block the road and beckon travellers to eat.
With only minutes to go before the call to prayer, Saad and others flag down a bus packed with some 60 passengers.
Omar Hussein, the bus driver, travels the route regularly and is always stopped as iftar time approaches.
""I never worry about missing iftar,"" Hussein said. ""I am always sure someone will offer us something on the way.""

                        Democratic Republic Of Congo
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Felix Tshisekedi concluded the year 2020 with the inauguration of an interchange and flyover that should ease traffic congestion in the megacity of more than 10 million inhabitants.
The interchange spanning busy crossroads in the capital, Kinshasa, is the result of the ""100-day emergency program"" launched by the Congolese President, shortly after he came to power early 2019.
""As is well known, Kinshasa has serious problems with population growth. That is why, as part of the 100-day program, the president took the initiative to build this infrastructure, which was inaugurated today"", said Giscard Kusema, assistant press secretary to the presidency.
The inauguration of the project comes at a time when Kinshasa, one of Africa's most populous capitals, is experiencing constant growth during a curfew imposed by the president in the face of rising Covid-19 cases in the capital.
""It really meets our expectations in a sense that, little by little, Kinshasa is becoming less congested so hence our joy today. And as we have just inaugurated, this is a great moment of joy because we are really going to celebrate, and there won't really be any traffic jams"", Serge Malemba, Kinshasa resident said.
These road interchanges and flyover will alleviate traffic problems aggravated by the curfew in Kinshasa, the largest city in this French-speaking African nation. For two years, traffic, already chaotic with the increase in the number of cars over the last fifteen years, was slowed down due to the construction, especially on the road to the airport.

Cairo's ""City of the Dead"" Comes Back to Life

                        Egypt
In Egypt's ""City of the Dead"", centuries-old monuments are being restored and artisanal heritage revived, turning a corner of the vast historical cemetery into a vibrant neighbourhood full of life.
Wood, leather and jewellery workshops have joined those of glassblowers and others near the 15th-Century mosque of Sultan Qaitbay, in the east of the capital Cairo.
From the Mamluk period, the celebrated structure -- featured on Egypt's one-pound notes -- is surrounded by monumental tombs, dusty alleys and informal housing.
Since 2014, a series of projects financed by the European Union has changed the face of this small section of the sprawling necropolis -- home to many people who are unable to afford Cairo's prohibitively high rents.
Authorities began construction on a major road in July a short distance from the Qaitbay mosque, drawing strong criticism online for the resulting demolitions and evictions of residents of the ""City of the Dead"".
A final resting place for illustrious figures, including singer Farid al-Atrash and writer Ihsan Abdel Kouddous as well as ordinary Egyptians, the Islamic necropolis founded in the seventh century stretches over 6.5 kilometres (four miles).
""Before the projects, there was rubbish all over the streets"", said 57-year-old Issem Abou Rami, who owns a small restaurant facing the mosque. ""Now, a truck comes every day to collect it.""
Products made in the impoverished neighbourhood are now sold in elegant booths under restored stone arches -- and even online.
Social developmentThe renovation efforts started six years ago with the refurbishment of a drinking trough for animals, and then, the reception area of a residential complex of the sultan.
The EU contributed nearly a million euros ($1.1 million) toward the latest project, ""T_he Heritage for the Living, in the 'City of the Dead'_"", which launched in 2018 and focuses on social development.
The project coordinator, architect Agnieszka Dobrowolska, was a linchpin to the area's metamorphosis.
She supervised the restorations of the monuments and the renovation of the workshop and their signage, as well as designed jewellery and leather products inspired by Mamluk motifs.
""When we first came here, our main object was to conserve the monuments,"" she told AFP.
""And we quickly realised that we cannot simply conserve the monuments, in disrespect to the people who live and work in the area,"" adds Dobrowolska, founder of Archinos Architecture, which has worked on numerous conservation projects in Cairo.
Work in the ateliers was interrupted for several weeks due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but now the workshops are again up and running, with some 50 women making leather products and jewellery, all stamped with the local brand Mishka.
Aida Hassan, 45, has worked in the leather workshop for three years, and said she is happy to be earning ""1,500 pounds ($96) per month -- and sometimes more"".
""This project has helped improve my income,"" she added, saying she had gone on to train other women in leatherwork.
Hundreds of women and children in the neighbourhood have benefited from courses and workshops on subjects as diverse as science and technology, English language and sports.
Object of superstitionFor the EU, the primary donor to the project -- due to end in 2021 -- the social elements of the programme were key, said Christian Berger, head of the EU delegation in Egypt.
""Our intention is to support this type of project that benefits immediately vulnerable groups and disadvantaged groups, projects that have a broader socio-economic impact,"" Berger said.
The neighbourhood has hosted concerts, from jazz to folk and traditional Egyptian music, and visual artists from Egypt and abroad have come to show their work.
The aim is to bring ""contemporary art and culture here to enhance diversity of cultural expression (and) artistic expression, to build bridges between east and west,"" said Dobrowolska.
Another hope of the project in transforming the neighbourhood is to draw in tourists.
The ""City of the Dead"" is sometimes an object of superstition due to its status as a necropolis, and is not a usual stop on mainstream Cairo tours.
But it is the tourists who are looking for something out of the ordinary that Dobrowolska said the project is counting on.
""We seek to attract tourists who are off-track from the mass tourism destinations -- people who might appreciate and enjoy the unique urban character of the necropolis,"" she said.

Afrofuturistic AKON CITY Underway in Senegal
                                                      Artist Akon officially kicks off the AKON CITY project in Senegal

                        Senegal
Business Development in AfricaAkon City, the futuristic pan-African city named after and envisioned by Senegalese-American Hip hop R&B recording artist Akon, is officially underway. Located in Mbodiene, Senegal some 100 kilometres from the capital, the grammy-nominated star intends for this project to provide much-needed jobs to the Senegalese and serve as home to people of African ancestry in the Diaspora who feel out of place due to racial injustice they face outside the Motherland.
Akon City is afrofuturistic
He explained, ""I wanted to build a city with or a project like this, that will give them (Black Americans) the motivation that there is a home back home and it's something they can relate to. That they are familiar with, and it's something they don't have to fear and they also have a choice. Because the system back home treats them unfairly in so many different ways that you can never imagine. And they only go through it because they feel that there is no other way.""  
Afro Diaspora and AfricaAkon, who was born in the United States to Senegalese parents, spent much of his childhood in the West African country.
Senegalese authorities have embraced him as a native son, introducing him by his given name Aliuane Thiam and praising him for investing in Africa at a time of such global financial uncertainty.
Alioune Sarr, Minister of Tourism and Air Transport, expressed his admiration and appreciation for such a huge investment in Senegal, ""This is how we show ourselves in Africa, that while Covid-19 makes all the countries of the world doubt the confidence they have in their economy, during this time, a Senegalese, an investor, who could stay in the United States all his life, decides to come and invest in his country.""
It was a true celebratory kickoff indeed on Monday as the first phase of the $6 billion project will begin in 2021 — with a third of the financial investment already secured by as yet unidentified investors due to non-disclosure agreements.
Afrofuturistic ParadiseAkon could not contain his excitement, ""When this project came about that was actually before the movie ('Black Panther'). But when the movie came it was almost like a blessing, almost like God allowed this movie to be successful for me to get compared to such success to give people that mind state that this can be possible in Africa. And it also motivated us too when we were creating the city from an architectural standpoint that it has to feel and it has to be futuristic.""
RIP Chadwick Boseman and ""Wakanda Forever"" perhaps in the form of Akon City
Akon City is to be an African utopia with everything available to its inhabitants. Its own hospital, police stations, plus a seaside resort, a tech hub and even a recording studio. A hotel within the city plans is to feature rooms with themes of each of the 54 African countries. The city will also boast a zone dubbed ""Senewood"" that developers hope will evolve into a thriving film industry in Senegal and even have its own cryptocurrency already named AKoin.
The almost surrealist, water-like designs of Akon City will be structured out of glass and metal - and were inspired by forms of traditional African art found in villages continent-wide since the beginning of Africa’s long history.
Many compare Akon City to Wakanda, the fictional technologically advanced African kingdom in the blockbuster record-breaking movie ‘Black Panther.’ A huge honour for Akon, especially after having just lost the Chadwick Boseman at 43 years to colon cancer — the iconic and beloved actor who portrayed the royal superhero in the film and was a real-life hero to many in the global Afro community.

Congo marks 60 years of independence

                        Republic of Congo
The Republic of Congo has commemorated its 60th anniversary of independence.
President Denis Sassou Nguesso on saturday underlined the ""progress"" made in his country, a former French colony.
During a ceremony to mark the anniversary, Sassou Nguesso, who has been in power for 35 years, spoke at length about the infrastructure built in the central African country since it gained independence from France.
""At independence, our country did not have a single kilometre of asphalt pavement... today, we have a total of 3,111 kilometres (1,933 miles) of asphalt roads, with crossings on practically all our major rivers,"" he said in a speech to the nation.
He also pointed to an increase in large hospitals -- from one in 1960 to eight today and a dozen under construction -- and advances in education with more than 2,000 schools built across the country.
His enthusiasm was not shared by all, however.
""When President Sassou is satisfied with road construction, it's a joke,"" said Roch Euloge Nzobo, coordinator at the local NGO Human Rights and Development Circle.
""In 60 years of independence, Congo does not even have a motorway,"" he told AFP, adding that ""corruption is endemic"" throughout the country.
Sassou Nguesso, whose re-election in 2016 was contested and has caused unrest, has already been nominated as the candidate of the ruling Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in the next presidential ballot, due next March.
The oil-rich country is currently facing several political and socio-economic challenges.
After the fall in oil prices in 2014, the country's economy has been further weakened by the coronavirus pandemic.

Somalia not only rebuilding but thriving

                        Somalia
By Fridah Mlemwa
After years of civil war and battling Al Shabaab militants Somalia seems to be putting itself back together. According to the African Union Mission In Somalia (AMISOM) the East African nation has a thriving real estate, with people developing the capital Mogadishu.

 The road infrastructure is also improving in the country especially in the capital. The United Nations Office for Project Services has even launched US$ 9 million to expand municipal infrastructure. So far, the project has successfully delivered 4.9 kilometers of road in Garowe and 7.5 kilometers of road on Mogadishu, increasing access and economic activity in these regions according to a statement by UN Assistance Mission in Somalia?
The International Monetary Fund has also just announced its commitment to help Somalia access some debt relief and secure financial resources, a huge step towards rebuilding the East African nation. The latest IMF analysis of Somalia notes that the country is in “debt distress,” with its $4.7 billion in external debt equivalent to its entire GDP, and no way to repay any of it; 96 percent of Somalia’s debt is already in arrears, meaning even if it never borrows another dime, its debt burden will continue to grow, says Foreign Policy But the IMF is helping the country to clear its arrears and is talking to countries owed by Somalia to forgive the debts.

DR Congo, Uganda to jointly build 1,200 km connecting roads

                        Uganda
Congo’s President Felix Tshisekedi was in Uganda over the weekend to promote trade between the neighboring countries, after Rwanda closed its border with Uganda.
After meeting with Congo’s leader in Uganda’s capital, Kampala, on Saturday Uganda’s President Yoweri Museveni said the two countries will build stronger ties.
“We shall build roads and bridges connecting the two countries,” said Museveni. “This is about trade, social welfare and security. To guarantee security, you need roads for easy movement of soldiers. But this can also help people to move to hospitals.”
Trade between the two countries was $513 million last year, but could increase as Uganda now eyes neighboring Congo, following the closure of the border with Rwanda in February.
Museveni and Tshisekedi agreed to jointly build 1,200 kilometers of roads from Uganda to the three eastern Congo cities, Goma, Bunia and Beni.
The pledge to build new roads to the eastern Congo centers comes despite the fact that they have been attacked by different rebel groups in Congo and that Congo is currently fighting an Ebola outbreak in the area.
The presidents said the two countries’ ministers of foreign affairs, infrastructure and finance would meet within two months and to plan construction of the roads.

Congo's road toll saga [Business segment]

As a way to finance the construction of more roads and to help offset debt incurred in developing infrastructure, many African governments are introducing charges for road users.
But toll fees are largely unpopular. In the Republic of Congo, the government is locked in a conflict with truckers over charges on the National Highway number one that runs from the port city of Pointe-Noire to the capital, Brazzaville.
On this business segment, presenter Jean-David Mihamle explores how the row could hurt Congo’s haulers, if not addressed.

Mozambique: Chinese-built Maputo Bridge to help boost economy

The Maputo-Katembe Bridge, Mozambique, would help improve people’s livelihood and boost the economy of the southeast African country.
The bridge now the longest suspension bridge in Africa,, which hovers across the Maputo Bay with a main span of 680 meters, was officially opened to traffic last November.
The three-kilometer-long bridge connects the capital, Maputo on the northern bank with its disjunct suburb of Katembe on the southern bank.
Gila local resident living in Maputo says Before the bridge was constructed, it took him about 2-3 hours by ferry. But now it takes only several minutes.
“I’m buying the food from South Africa. I’m going to Maputo. Before it took maybe four to five hours to reach the border. There was a long queue and then the road was bad. But now if you need to go to Boane borough, it’s easy,” said Seigo, Maputo resident.
The Bridge and Link Roads project will serve as the arterial highway that directly links capital city Maputo southward to the border with South Africa.
It includes the North Link Road, the North Approach Bridge, the Main Bridge, the South Approach Bridge and the South Link Road, with a total length of 187 km.
The Construction of the 785.8 million U.S. dollars project started in June 2014.With 95 percent of the funding provided by China through preferential and buyers’ loans.
