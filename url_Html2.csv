She shared her deep connection with Jamnagar and her love for Anant Ambani. Radhika witnessed the birth of a baby elephant and praised Anant's project Vantara. They are excited for their wedding in Jamnagar. Radhika Merchant and Anant Ambani  On Day 1 of their lavish three-day pre-wedding celebrations in Jamnagar, to-be bride and Ambani bahu, Radhika Merchant expressed her love and gratitude for all members of the Ambani family. While she called Nita Ambani an inspiration, she shared that Mukesh Ambani is a father-figure to her. Moreover, she also shared her love for Anant Ambani-- her life-partner and how they build their relationship over the years in Jamnagar.Radhika Merchant said, ""For Anant and me, Jamnagar is where our heart is. This is where we grew-up, where we became friends, where we fell in love, and where we built our relationship. Now as we begin our future together, we will be doing it here, and we are so thankful when you get to see the beginning of it. This place has become a part of our fondest memories, my deepest secrets, our loudest laughs, and the happiest times that we have had together as a family. It has seen us go through all our ups and downs.""Sharing a lesser-known detail about their relationship, Radhika further said, ""In March of 2020, Anant and I got locked down here and we couldn't go back to see our families for months. Although it was hard to stay away, we learnt to appreciate the small joys of life. But in Jamnagar, and with Anant, the small joys are a once in a lifetime experiences. One day we got a call saying one of our rescued elephants was giving birth. Since she was brought up in captivity she was extremely stressed by the process. I watched as Anant stood there with the mahavat, through an eight-hour labour process, calmly talking to her. Now we have a beautiful baby Hanuman, who is almost four-years-old and is as naughty as ever.""Talking about Anant's ambitious project Vantara and how she has seen it shape over the years, Radhika said, ""People ask me when did Anant start Vantara? I don't think there is any start date. It has always just been in his heart. He has been able to formalise this institution more over the years. I have had the privilege of watching Anant and his team pour their hearts and souls into making this vision a reality. Anant, I will never be able to express how proud I am of you.""Radhika then expressed her love for Anant, whom she is all set to marry on July 12, 2024. Talking of love and marriage, Radhika said, ""Someone once told me what do you really find when you find a partner. What you really find is somebody to witness your life. There are over a billion people on this Earth and what does one life really mean? But when you find somebody, you find somebody to promise you to care about everything-- the good, the bad, the beautiful, the bold, the sad, and the mundane. You say, 'I will see you everyday. Your life will not go unnoticed because I will witness it'. Anant, I am so blessed to be a witness to your beautiful life."" She added, ""Anant and I are so blessed to have you here in Jamnagar. It is an example of how expansive the Indian industry could be, how expansive a human heart can be. Anant's grandfather, Shri Dhirubhai Ambani, dreamt of opening the world's largest refinery here, Mukesh uncle executed this dream with precision, and Nita aunty built a vibrant township and a green belt which was once a barren land. This gave Anant the world's greatest canvas to fulfil his passions. Three generations of our family have worked together and dedicated themselves to Jamnagar, and we feel so humbled to be able to share it with you all today. Thank you once again for being a part of our celebrations. I hope the grace, beauty and magic of Vantara touches your hearts like it has ours.""Anant and Radhika formally got engaged in January 2023, after knowing each other for a few years. Radhika Merchant is the youngest daughter of Encore Pharmaceuticals' CEO Viren Merchant and his wife Shaila Merchant. On Day 1 of their lavish three-day pre-wedding celebrations in Jamnagar, to-be bride and Ambani bahu, Radhika Merchant expressed her love and gratitude for all members of the Ambani family.

Visuals of Reliance Chairperson Mukesh Ambani breaking down in tears have gone viral across the internet. During his address at the event, Anant opened up about his health struggles in childhood, moving his father to tears. He expressed, 'My family has gone all out to make me feel special. Everyone has been sleeping for less than 3 hours a day for the last 2-3 months. My life has not been entirely a bed of roses. I have experienced the pain of thorns and faced many health issues since childhood, but my father and mother have never let me feel that I have suffered. They have always stood by me.' Anant Ambani thanked his parents for making him feel special and instilling confidence in him. He added, 'Thank you, Mumma, for all that you've done. All this is created by my Mumma and no one else. For the last four months, she has worked, I think, 18-19 hours a day. I am extremely grateful to Mumma. My father and mother have always stood by me and made me feel that if I think, I'll do it. That is how much my father and mother mean to me, and I will be eternally grateful.' During his speech, Anant referred to himself as a 'lucky man' while talking about his fiancée, Radhika. He said, 'I am 100 percent the lucky one; there is no doubt about that. I also don't know how I got Radhika, so I am definitely the luckiest here. I have known her for seven years, but it feels like we met only yesterday. Every day, I fall more and more in love. I have earthquakes and tsunamis in my heart when I see Radhika.' Earlier this week, the couple commenced their pre-wedding celebrations by organizing a communal feast. Thousands of attendees from nearby villages were hosted and treated to a selection of delightful Gujarati dishes. At the heart of the enchanting three-day celebration is a distinguished gathering of over 1,000 guests, including some of the world's most affluent and influential individuals.

All this is created by my mother and no one else. My mother has gone all out… For four months she has worked, I think, for 18-19 hours a day. I am extremely grateful to mom and thank you so much.""He added, ""I would like to thank each and everyone of you present here. I know every one has made it to Jamnagar to make me and Radhika feel special. We are honoured and humbled to have all of you here. I am sorry if we have caused any inconvenience to any one. Please do forgive us, both the families. I hope everyone is going to enjoy the coming three days and I would like to thank my mother, my father, my sister, my brother, my sister-in-law, and my brother-in-law for making this event so memorable for me and Radhika. I think my family has gone all out to make us feel special. Everyone has been sleeping for less than three hours a day for the last two to three months and I'm so happy I can share this joy with everyone out here.""Talking about his personal struggles and how his parents have always supported him, Anant said, ""As many of you know my life has not always been an entire bed of roses. I have also experienced the pain of thorns. I have faced many health crisis. But my father and mother have never let me feel that I have suffered. My father and mother have always stood by me and they have always made me feel that if I think, I'll do it. I think that is what my father and mother mean to me, and I am eternally grateful to them.""On loveSharing how grateful he is to have Radhika as his life partner, Anant further said, ""I'm 100% the lucky one (to get Radhika), there is no doubt about that! I also don't know how I got Radhika. While I know Radhika for the last seven years, it feels I met Radhika just yesterday. But everyday I fall more in love with her. Like my brother-in-law, Anand Piramal, says-- when he used to see my sister Isha he had volcanoes and fountains going up in his heart. I would say I have earthquakes and tsunamis going on in my heart when I see Radhika. So thank you Radhika for everything. Viren uncle, Shaila aunty, Anjali-Aman, thank you for welcoming me into your family with open arms. I am extremely thankful and grateful to you for having the patience for the last seven years, finally the day is coming.""On his grandparents(Image: https://www.instagram.com/nitaambaniril/)Anant also took the blessings from his grandmother, Kokilaben Ambani whom he ""takes great inspiration from"". Sharing how close he is to his maternal grandmother, he added, ""My nani is a nagar-brahmin. I have stayed mostly with my nani when I was young and she has taught me everything... Radhika's Nana and my Nana blessing us from top, I'm sure they'll be extremely happy today.""He also shared how his dream-project Vantara-- which aims at rescuing, treating and rehabilitating injured wild animals-- is due to his grandfather Dhirubhai Ambani and his parents' support. ""My parents taught me to always serve others, and this is my way of giving back to the society... I started of small. My grandfather said 'Dare to dream', so i dreamt and made it a reality,"" Anant said.Hearing Anant's speech, Mukesh Ambani looked quite touched and proud as a father of the to-be groom.

Anna Seva strengthens spiritual bonds and promotes meaningful interactions in a marriage.  ‘Marriage’ is one of the most significant and crucial parts of ‘16 Sanskaar’ as prescribed in our shastras. The pre-marriage celebrations for Anant Ambani, the youngest son of Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani, and Radhika Merchant, the daughter of industrialist Viren Merchant, have commenced with 'anna seva'.Let us dive into details and understand the significance of ‘Anna Seva’ as per traditions and shastra:What is ‘Anna Seva’?Selfless service, or seva, is a spiritual practice that aims to transcend the ego and develop empathy for all beings.It embodies the idea of ""Nishkama Karma,"" which is the practice of doing without regard for the results of one's deeds.Fundamentally, Anna Seva is the act of giving meals to people in need without thinking about getting anything in return. Anna Seva is a highly esteemed figure who represents kindness, giving, and peace in society. Caste, creed, and religious barriers are transcended, highlighting the universality of human goodwill.‘Anna Seva’ - The Epitome of Karma YogaKarma Yoga is centred on Nishkama Karma, which in turn blesses the human with purity at mind, body, and soul levels. Anna Seva helps people dedicate themselves to society. Serving food thanks them for plenty and connects them to all. Karma Yoga's Anna Seva practice fosters spiritual growth and transformation. Healing the mind and cultivating compassion are steps to self-realisation.Significance of ‘Anna Seva’Our classics explicitly teach 'serving humanity is service to the almighty’ and ‘anna seva’ is a great example of serving the needy human kind without any discrimination.Significance of ‘Anna Seva’ in MarriageAnna Seva is of the utmost symbolic significance in pre marriage ceremonies. The couple values hospitality, kindness, and social responsibility.While doing Anna Seva together, couples can overcome their differences and uphold the unison of two souls as one soul going after and work with oneness in approach toward serving others and upholding morality.Anna Seva activities improve marriages and develop collaboration. Serving food shows compassion, empathy, and generosity, which are essential for a happy marriage.Serving together strengthens partners' spiritual bonds, helping them grow in love and wisdom.Serving food together as a pair fosters meaningful interactions, shared experiences, and increased emotional bonding at energy level.We wish the couple a blessed time aheadThis article is written by Sidhharrth S Kumaar, Astro Numerologist, Energy Healer, Life & Relationship Coach, NumroVani.FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA Visual Stories   PreviousTop 5 Zodiac Signs That Are Inclined Towards Acting CareerindiaHow Your Zodiac Sign Deals With Breakupindia5 Zodiac Signs That Make Fake PromisesindiaLove and Relationship Horoscope for March 2024indiaLove and Relationship Horoscope for February 29, 2024indiaZodiac Signs Who Are Born Fightersindia​How Each Zodiac Sign Acts When They Like Someone​india​Love Horoscope for February 28, 2024indiaLove and Relationship Horoscope for February 27, 2024indiaThe Most Selfish Zodiac Signs As Per Astrologyindia Next123Hot PicksMP Gautam GambhirAir India FineNoida Student Killing CaseAkasa Air Bomb Threat NewsPM ModiShubhkaran SinghJNU Student Clash NewsTOP TRENDINGRameshwaram CafePM Modi in BiharPakistan Ravi RiverKolkata Dancer Amarnath GhoshPriyanka GandhiHimachal Congress CrisisDMK ISRO ad with Chinese flagBJP Lok Sabha Candidates ListVemireddy Prabhakar ReddyBCCI player contractsTrending StoriesIn AstrologyEntire WebsiteHoroscope Today, December 6, 2023: Read your daily astrological prediction for Aquarius, Pisces and OthersHoroscope Today, December 1, 2023: Read your daily astrological prediction for Aries, Taurus and OthersHoroscope Today, November 24, 2023: Read your daily astrological predictionHoroscope Today, November 20, 2023: Read your daily astrological predictionHoroscope Today, November 17, 2023: Read your daily astrological prediction for Aries; Work related short travel may be expectedChhath Puja 2023 Date and Time: From Nahaye Khaye to Usha Arghya, Know Puja Rituals and SignificanceHoroscope Today, November 16, 2023: Read your daily astrological prediction for Aries, Taurus and OthersBhai Dooj 2023: When is Bhai Dooj?
