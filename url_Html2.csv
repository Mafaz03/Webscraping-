China’s Belt and Road Initiative has gained momentum since its commencement 10 years ago in 2013.
Initially it had a regional focus but rapidly expanded beyond central Asia towards the Middle East, Africa, South America, Eastern Europe and the Indo Pacific regions, making it the biggest such program since the Marshall Plan after World War II.
Logically, there was a sharp increase in the number of projects, total investments committed and executed, and the number of countries joining as partners. 
The current number of countries and organizations stand at over 150.
China stressed that the BRI was a new model for partnership, trade and integration that was free from hegemonic pressures and conditions. Later the principles of multilateralism, environment and sustainability were embedded in the BRI.
The West, fearing China’s rapid influence through the BRI, came up with competing initiatives such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (G7), the Global Gateway (EU), the Quality Infrastructure Investment Program (Japan), and others, but their ability to rival the BRI in scale is yet to be established.
As PNG joined these 150 other countries and organizations in Beijing this month to review their involvements in the BRI, the Post-Courier takes a brief look at three projects that have been rolled out in PNG under the auspices of the BRI.
PNG National Power Grid Phase One Project
The PNG national power grid, which includes a 132kV transmission and substations for Mt Hagen, Mendi, Tari, represents the first collaborative energy infrastructure endeavor between PNG and China under the Belt and Road Initiative.
This project closely aligns with PNG’s national energy strategy, which aims to increase electricity accessibility from the current 15% to 70% by 2030 and ultimately transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
The project is funded by the China Exim Bank and executed by the contractor TBEA Co., Ltd.
The project owner is PNG Power, the project scope consists of the construction of four new 132kV substations (Mt. Hagen, Pauanda, Mendi, and Tari) and a 180-kilometer 132kV transmission line connecting these substations.
Upon completion, it significantly increased the power grid coverage, effectively alleviated energy shortages, and greatly improved grid stability and reliability in the Highlands region.
The project directly benefits residents of the three Highlands provinces (Western Highlands Province, Southern Highlands Province and Hela Province) and provides power to adjacent mining projects, including gold and copper mines.
Consequently, it will efficiently stimulate economic growth in those regions connected by the power grid. 
This initiative can also meet the electricity demands of millions of households and residents, thus improving the quality of life for local communities.
PNG National Submarine Cable Network Project
Before 2015, due to the complex geographical environment and insufficient transportation infrastructure, internet access remained relatively expensive in PNG, with only about 12 percent of PNG residents connected to the internet.
There was no backbone network in PNG. The backbone communication network between islands was mainly low-bandwidth and high-cost transmission network such as satellite and microwave. The bandwidth was limited.
New services such as high-speed mobile Internet could not be launched. 
With the development of the local economy, the existed bandwidth could not meet the market requirements.
The PNG National Submarine Cable Network Project (NSCNP) was implemented by PNG DataCo Ltd, a wholesale subsidiary of Kumul Telikom Holdings and a State-owned commercial entity.
This project was one of the high priority projects included in the Framework Agreement on Development Cooperation between China and PNG signed on July 8, 2016. 
The project was financed by EXIM Bank and was completed in June 2020.
This project was a 5457km submarine fiber cable network project connecting 14 major cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang and Lae. 
The submarine fiber cable connects to Jayapura in Indonesia.
At the same time, 14 submarine cable landing sites were built in 14 cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang, and Lae, to install submarine cable terminal equipment and network access equipment. 
Two data centers were also built in Port Moresby and Madang, used for supporting the operation of submarine cable services.
Project Benefits
Firstly, the project has improved the bandwidth, reliability and stability of PNG’s domestic network.
It helped reduce the internet pricing by introducing competition mechanism;Secondly, the project connects PNG to China through Indonesia. 
The submarine cable has become an important international network channel for the South Pacific island countries;
Thirdly, the project drives the digital economy to help the country’s socio-economic progress and development.
Juncao and Upland Rice Project
Early in 2000, Fujian Province of China and Eastern Highlands Province of PNG signed a sister province agreement and listed Juncao and upland rice technology as the aiding technology to Eastern Highlands Province by Fujian Province. 
This project was carried out by the team of Prof. Lin Zhanxi from Fujian University of Agriculture and Forestry (FUAF). This project is now in its fourth phase.
In November 2018, during President Xi’s visit to PNG, leaders of the two countries witnessed the signing of the project, the first phase of which started in August 2019 and ended in August 2022. 
In February 2022, the two countries signed the second phase of the project, which will be implemented over a three-year period from September 2022 to August 2025.
Project Implementation
The project has overcome the difficulties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, and has overfulfilled the tasks of the project in the fields of training, demonstration, production and extension.
In total, 27 technical training courses have been held, and a total of 2,921 people have been trained; Juncao mushroom, Juncao animal husbandry, and upland rice planting have been promoted to 17 districts in nine provinces, with a total of more than 10,000 farmers and 40,000 people benefiting from the project; and set the world record for highest output of pennisetum giganteum (Juncao grass), which was 8.53 tons per hectare.
Eastern Highlands Province has listed the Juncao and upland rice industries as the second and third major agricultural industries to be developed after the coffee industry.
Achievements and impact of project implementation
The project has benefited many farmers in PNG and improved the agricultural skills level of the farmers. 
It became a model of Belt and Road Initiative cooperation between China and PNG, and played a very important role in deepening the development cooperation between the two countries and the sister-province relationship between Fujian and Eastern Highlands provinces.
The project team has provided local farmers with 1,226,700 Juncao mushroom tubes, and more than 1,725 farmers have participated in the cultivating Juncao mushroom.
The farmers mainly produce oyster mushroom and sell the harvested fresh mushroom to supermarkets, local market and supermarkets in Port Moresby.
Zaka Abori, a woman mushroom farmer, started growing mushroom in February 2020 with the help of Chinese experts and selling them through supermarkets, Facebook and social media.
The profit of growing mushroom are 20-30 times higher than her original cabbage cultivation, and the expansion of her earnings has allowed her to independently set up a tube production workshop, and her Juncao mushroom business is booming.
Farmers have planted more than 130 hectares of Juncao grass, and 1798 households have raised chickens, pigs, sheep, cows and other livestock using Juncao grass, significantly reducing their costs. 
In 7 districts including Goroka, Lufa, Hengenofi, Unggai Bena, Daulo and Kainantu, the project has promoted upland rice cultivation over 1215 hectares, and has supported more than 20 large upland rice producers and cooperatives, and promoted 7604 growers, which has brought great economic benefits to the local community.
The implementation of the project has promoted the development of Juncao, livestock and upland rice industries in PNG through technical training and demonstration, and opened up a new way for increasing employment and farmers’ income, as well as environmental protection, coping with climate change and sustainable development in PNG.

                        China
In Beijing this week, the tenth-year milestone of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be marked at a forum that highlights this often-debated model for economic development.
Large signs reading ""The Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation"" are displayed next to a bustling Beijing road. The previous forums convened in 2017 and 2019.  
This program, championed by China's President Xi Jinping, has provided funding for numerous global infrastructure projects, including ports, power plants, and railways. Nevertheless, the initiative has received criticism for its approach to providing loans to developing nations, which often results in them incurring substantial debt.
Wang Yiwei, the Director of the Institute of International Affairs at China's Renmin University, asserts that BRI encourages a collaborative approach to development with partner nations, providing them with paths to modernization.
Recent events, such as the construction of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in Indonesia, which commenced earlier this month, underscore the mixed reception BRI has encountered. While this 142-kilometer railway significantly reduces travel time between Jakarta and Bandung, it was marred by delays and escalating costs. Originally expected to launch in 2019, disputes over land acquisition, environmental concerns, and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the project. Furthermore, the estimated cost of 66.7 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion USD) ballooned to 113 trillion rupiah ($7.3 billion USD).
Similarly, the $5.9 billion Chinese-built railway linking Laos' capital, Vientiane, to the southern Chinese city of Kunming began operations in 2021, with over 60% of the investment being borrowed – an unusually high percentage for an infrastructure project, according to foreign experts. This has led to the initiative being perceived by some as a ""debt trap.""
Chinese contractors are also constructing a high-speed rail line from Bangkok to the Laos border, expected to be operational by 2028.
An example of a debt issue emerged earlier this year when a power plant in Jordan, once touted as a groundbreaking project to provide the country with a significant energy source, turned sour. Jordan now finds itself in an international legal battle and billions of dollars in debt to China for a plant that is no longer necessary for its energy needs, due to subsequent agreements made since the project's inception.
A ""risk prevention"" approach will be critical for the future of the Belt and Road Initiative, given the growing complications in a world marked by ongoing conflicts.
The Belt and Road Initiative Forum is scheduled to commence on October 18.

TotalEnergies PNG Limited has announced that it is becoming a Platinum Principal Sponsor of the 17th Papua New Guinea Resources & Energy Investment Conference and Exhibition.
The conference organised by the PNG Chamber of Mines and Petroleum will be held from the 10th to the 13th of December 2023 at the Sydney International Convention Centre.
TotalEnergies, one of the world’s largest energy companies, is the developer of the US$10billion Papua LNG Project.
TotalEnergies PNG Ltd Acting Managing Director Fabrice Brouard said the conference is a valuable opportunity for networking, learning, and showcasing the potential of PNG’s resources sector.
“This year we hope to announce (at the Sydney Conference) the awarding of our Early Works contract Packages, our National Content Policy, and developments in key community initiatives, as we work towards FID in 2024,”he said.
Mr Brouard said the conference brings together key stakeholders from the government, industry, and civil society to discuss the challenges and opportunities facing the sector and highlights the achievements and best practices of PNG’s mining and petroleum projects.
“The conference is also a great platform to showcase how Papua LNG is and will be a catalyst for enhancing the social and economic development of PNG and its people. 
In addition, it gives us the opportunity to show the Project’s endeavor to be a landmark project in terms of sustainability, carbon footprint optimisation, and biodiversity considerations.”
“The conference is a strategic platform for promoting and attracting responsible investment in PNG’s resources sector. 
We hold to our view of Papua New Guinea as a worthy and attractive investment destination. 
It will continue to attract and retain investment especially within this sector.”
PNG Chamber of Mines & Petroleum President Anthony Smaré: “We are delighted that TotalEnergies is coming on board as a headline sponsor of the Conference.
“TotalEnergies, through its leadership of the Papua LNG Project, is a major partner in PNG’s development and we look forward to hearing from them of their plans for the new mega-project at the Conference.”
This year’s conference is anticipated to be the biggest investment conference held with over 1500 attendees, and 4 floors of the Sydney International Convention Centre reserved for the 4-day duration of the Conference.
With a program designed to promote investment in PNG’s resources and energy sector, as well as the non- resources sector, the event is anticipated to draw an unprecedented number of attendees and attention.

                        Algeria
China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the ""best guarantee of development"", stressing that ""our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km."" The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
""China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner,"" said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
""The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth,"" he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
""As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities,"" said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
""This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone,"" echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

In a lecture room at the Electrical Engineering Department of the Papua New Guinea University of Technology in Lae, Morobe Province, participants of a three-week long ‘Renewable Energy’ Training stood in awe as the lecturer demonstrated how a smart electricity grid works.As the students gathered around the device, the lecturer explained how the grid could simultaneously utilise wind, hydro and solar power to produce clean energy.When one energy source turned off, the others would continue to produce power and ensure continued electricity supply.The lecturer asserted that such grids were key to expanding electricity access in Papua New Guinea, where only 20 per cent of the population currently enjoys regular access to electricity.The training was held under the renewable energy component of the European Union-funded “Support to Rural Entrepreneurship, Investment and Trade” (STREIT) programme, which aims to expand electricity access in the rural areas of East and West Sepik Provinces through renewable energy solutions.As one of the implementing agencies of the programme, UNDP has installed solar photovoltaic systems to schools and health facilities in six sites in the targeted provinces.Over 30 seasoned electricians, engineers, PNG Power employees, and teachers from East and West Sepik Provinces attended the training in Lae to gain the necessary skills to maintain these systems and to become solar energy experts in their respective communities.This marked the third and final training for the participants since 2021. Mr. Wilson Lalu, an electrician with over 40 years of experience, says that the training gave him a new perspective on renewable energy.Mr. Wilson currently works on one of project sites of the STREIT Programme in Nagam, East Sepik Province.Under UNDP’s leadership, the project has installed 176 solar panels and connected them to a battery system that provides continuous power to all dormitories, classrooms and staff houses in a local school.“My involvement at Nagam was during the commissioning of the system. Being an electrician, I had never worked on solar systems like that before. The training has given me a new perspective on the industry,” Mr Lalu said.Computer science teacher and licenced electrician from Vanimo Secondary School Bobby Tagen, also participated in the training. In 2023, UNDP installed a solar photovoltaic system on the school grounds and connected it to the main grid operated by PNG Power.The initiative ensured reliable electricity access to the school’s over 800 students.“The system has been working perfectly since it was installed in 2023. This training taught me about how such systems can be kept running for a longer period of time. This knowledge will help me maintain the system in our school and has motivated me to continue promoting the use of solar power in my community,” Mr. Tagen said.The training was facilitated by the University of Technology’s Sustainable Energy Research Institute (SERI).The Director of SERI, Professor Dapsy Olatona, hopes the training will yield positive results for the communities of the participants.“Our aim is that the participants will return to their villages and take part in installing renewable energy systems, particularly solar systems, in a manner that SERI has taught them.”The Government of Papua New Guinea has set a target of connecting 70 per cent of Papua New Guinea’s population to renewable electricity by 2030. By 2050, the Government hopes to have reached universal electricity access throughout the country.UNDP hopes to contribute to this aim through its various initiatives in the country.In addition to its activities under the STREIT programme, UNDP is currently constructing a one-megawatt solar farm in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.The construction is funded by the Government of Japan and the engineers working on the project will undergo the same training at the PNG University of Technology in Lae.“UNDP is committed to supporting the Government in increasing access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy throughout Papua New Guinea.Without enhancing access to clean energy, we cannot succeed in our efforts to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and enhance environmental sustainability in Papua New Guinea,” stated UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Nicholas Booth, after the training.“The sustainable future of our planet depends on countries making a successful transition onto greener and cleaner forms of energy.The European Union is proud to finance and support this initiative that will enable Papua New Guinea to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and expand electricity access to some of the most vulnerable communities in the country,” added the European Union Ambassador to Papua New Guinea, H.E. Jacques Fradin.

Puma Energy Papua New Guinea has officially commissioned a solar project at its Napanapa Refinery, marking a milestone for the company’s solarisation journey, not only in PNG but also globally.The project, which took four months to build, saw the installation of 684 solar panels at the Napa Napa Refinery, outside Port Moresby.This new setup can deliver 300KW of solar power, producing 485.5 MWh of energy per year, which will help modernise and reduce the facility’s CO2 emissions.The development is a key part of Puma Energy’s sustainability strategy to reduce its operational GHG emissions.The company has set a sustainability target to reduce its global operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 15 per cent by the end of 2025 and by 35 per cent by the end of 2032.The solar project at Napa Napa refinery complements Puma Energy’s global program to connect its Puma branded retail stations and other sites to solar energy.
The company has already connected more than 250 Puma branded retail stations to solar energy, and is planning to connect 300 by the end of 2023.In total, the company has now installed 8875 MW of solar energy generation capacity across its operations. Alongside the solar capacity Puma Energy has already installed across its network, this project will allow Puma to apply the expertise gained through this installation to offer similar renewable solutions to our commercial customers in Papua New Guinea.This will mean they can benefit from reduced energy costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and a reliable supply of energy.Papua New Guinea company chairman and managing director, Hulala Tokome said: “We are proud that Puma Energy PNG has launched the company’s biggest solar project in the region. It highlights our firm long-term commitment to operating sustainably and responsibly in the country.”“Papua New Guinea’s enhanced nationally determined contribution sets out ambitious plans to reduce its carbon emissions by half by 2030 and be entirely carbon neutral by 2050. This project fully supports these goals and, by helping our customers to install similar renewable energy solutions, Puma Energy can play a major role in helping the country meet these environmental commitments and promote energy security.“Our ambition is to fulfil our purpose of energising communities while supporting the energy transition and reducing our environmental impact.”

BY FRANCO NEBASThe Morobe Provincial Government has signed an agreement with a Dubai-based company to build a solar power in the province.Morobe Governor Luther Wenge announced this when signing a memorandum of agreement with Dubai-based AstralENERGY.
Mr Wenge said power outages was a legacy issue to the people of Lae and Morobe for years.He said the issue was never being addressed by the past successive governments up until today.“Morobe is now looking towards Dubai to supply and installed two solar power plants possibly in Lae and Huon Gulf districts,” he said.
He said AstralENERGY has been engaged under the private investment programs arranged by the Morobe Provincial Government.To facilitate the finance and construction of the Energy Impact Projects or programs, such as with solar, hydro and geothermal power plants, are one of the key policies for this government,” he said.The solar power plants will be built and installed at two different locations.
“One will be located at Labu supplying power to the main industrial centres including the wharf and market areas while the other one to be built behind Martin Luther Seminary supplying Malahang Industrial centre and surrounding areas,”he said.The total capacity which to be generated shall be of 100 megawatt that capable to supply power to the city.Mr Wenge said the total cost of the project is K250 million and will be 50 per cent counter-funding between the AstralENERGY and Government of PNG through the Private Investment Program. The project will generate huge income for the province as the power will be sold at half price charged by PNG Power Limited.The company engaged by MPG as a partner in this economical viable project is AstralENERGY Project Management Services in PNG.It is a Dubai-based company but since having joint venture partners with provinces and government of PNG in such magnitude projects in its specialities, the company has then incorporated under the Investment Promotion Authority and in the process of establishing.AstralENERGY chief executive officer Richard Peter said the project is expected to commence before the end of June 2023.

The US government, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and Santos bring electricity to a rural community in Southern Highlands Province.In partnership with the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority, Santos through the Santos funded Oil Search Foundation (OSF) and USAID launched the Pimaga Rural Hospital Solar Electrification Project on March 28, at Pimaga, in Nipa Kutubu district, Southern Highlands Province.The mini grid installed through the project will now serve not only hundreds of patients seen at the clinic but will also provide power to the dozen or more clinic staff and their families who live on the compound.
Enhanced electrical capacity at the clinic will keep patients more comfortable, as well as allowing clinicians to carry out medical treatments more reliably and safely.Santos country chair PNG, Leon Buskens said the use of renewable energy such as solar demonstrates Santos’ Vision 2040 to be a leading global provider of clean fuels and investing in carbon reduction initiatives.“This collaboration with USAID and the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority (SHPHA) to bring electricity through the solar mini grid project will go a long way in providing a much-needed source of cheap, economically viable, and sustainable form of energy source,” Mr Buskens said.
Santos Foundation’s chief programs officer, Jean Martin said the Foundation is committed to working with their partners like SHPHA and the district development authority to strengthen the systems that enhance service delivery.“Reliable clean energy will improve service delivery at Pimaga Rural Hospital, and we are pleased to have been able to partner with USAID PEP to undertake this piece of work,” she said.The mini-grid project was supported through USAID’s Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership (USAID-PEP) Activity, a five-year project in partnership with the Government of PNG that will contribute to the goal of connecting 70 per cent of PNG’s population to electricity by 2030.

BY KENNY ROMANUSRumginae School of Nursing in North Fly district of Western province will be powered by solar, thanks to the North Fly district development authority.During the Inauguration ceremony of the school last Friday, the North Fly DDA presented the project completion certificate to the contractor and did the official opening of the solar power project.
Local MP James Donald with Harry Korea, Secretary for Mineral and Geohazards officially handed the certificate of project completion to the contractor, Swan Investment Limited.The 24 hours solar power project costs K2.5 million through the North Fly DDA from the Non CMCA basket to complete phase one, two and three.Mr Donald also mentioned to the community that the Kiunga District Hospital will be upgraded to a referral hospital and will have the similar facilities as Angau Hospital in Lae or the Port Moresby General Hospital.
The Rumginae School of Nursing dormitories are now connected with solar power and soon to commence with the staff housing and street lighting from the junction all the way to the mission station.There are total of 120 solar panels now powering the facilities and according to Mr. Kupaloma, he said they need another buildings to cater for the full access the amount of electricity produced.Meanwhile, Mr Donald said the St Montfort Teachers College in Kiunga will also recommence construction works courses.
The Member also said the setting up of an agriculture college was to be announced shortly.

The National Energy Authority has chosen solar energy infrastructure, including roof-tops and solar farms, as the best option for New Ireland Province’s electricity needs.NEA as part of its National Electricity Roll Out Plan (NEROP) has visited New Ireland Province where it held talks with the provincial management team on how both team will work to improve electricity supply to the province.NEA managing director, Ronald Meketa said the challenges for NIP and provinces with many isolated islands is the difficulty of running transmission lines from the main grid across the seas.
He said the best option for such inaccessible islands is for solar energy infrastructure including roof-tops and solar farms but that does not rule out the option of underwater transmission lines.“As long as the stakeholder, especially provincial governments are willing, NEA can assist in making that a reality, and reaffirms the NEA’s position,” he said.One of the options that was left open for discussion was whether NIP could access the excess power produced by Newscrest Lihir’s geothermal power installation that is used for its operation.
PNG has some of the most rugged and difficult terrains in the world, hundreds of its island villages are as isolated as compared to the remote villages in the highlands.Mr Meketa said this was primarily the reason why the government in 2017 adopted the National Energy Policy and is presently driving the electricity agenda through the NEA to implement the NEROP.“This year the NEC approved the Special Steering Committee for NEROP comprising of secretaries of the DNPM, Treasury and PNG Power Ltd with NEA taking the leading role,” he said.
“The NEA is primarily the state regulator of the electricity supply services and downstream gas industry and is also the policy maker of renewables in PNG.”However, Mr Meketa said, NEA is also filling the gap regarding the implementation aspects of driving projects by providing stakeholders, especially provincial governments with technical support, advisory roles in differing policies, and legal advice, and talking with project partners including multi-donor agencies to partner in power generation, transmission, power purchase agreements in areas where PPL cannot provide reliable grid and power, among others.NEA is now working with the government to begin its first pilot project for islands in PNG to provide rooftop and standalone solar panels starting with NIP.

The Mineral Resources Authority will save about 60 per cent of its annual energy bills averaging about K650,000 with the launching of its new photo-voltaic (PV) solar power system.The PV solar power system was launched yesterday at the Mining Haus by chairman of the MRA board, Benny Kimisive and officer-in-charge (OIC) Nathan Mosusu.The grid-tie system installed on the roof-top of the Mining Haus has a capacity of 162 kilowatts.
It will be used as a power source, which will operate concurrently with the PNG Power Limited (PPL) grid to supply the building’s power demand of about 250 kW.The system is designed to operate at optimum with the balance of the building’s power demand to be supplied by the PPL utility grid.This will have a great effect on the final electricity bills.
The project has been installed in partnership with PPL.It is part of PPL’s project called the “roof-top solar photovoltaic pilot project”.Mr Mosusu, while officiating at the event, said the project is a demonstration of MRA’s commitment towards achieving the government’s national strategic development plan of generating 25 per cent of electricity from renewable resources by 2030.
He said they have been relying on fossil fuel for electricity and that this was the beginning of a paradigm shift towards doing things smarter using greener technology, and solar energy is a step in the right direction.“In 2018 alone, PNG imported about 42,000 barrels of fossil fuel oil and MRA’s new power source would contribute to the reduction in these statistics,” Mr Mosusu said.“The OIC said the biggest share of the 42, 000 barrels of oil, would no doubt, be attributed to the power requirements of the mining industry.“As the regulator, we at MRA must set the standards in reducing our carbon footprint, so that the industry can hopefully follow suit.”Board chairman, Mr Kimisive, said the board had been supportive of this project since its inception, adding that this would greatly reduce MRA’s power cost.He said there were more of such projects in the pipeline and the board would continue to support MRA’s management in achieving these projects.PNG Power Limited CEO Obed Batia said in a statement that the initiative of roof-top solar PV project is part of the organisation’s Pacific Renewable Energy Advisory Project, which is supported by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).He said under this project, 10 organisations were participating, including MRA, adding that MRA was the first participant to have successfully installed the system.

PNG Power Limited and the Milne Bay Provincial Government have entered into a historic partnership which sees the provincial authority funding a 0.8 Megawatts hybrid solar farm for its Alotau township.
Milne Bay Governor, Gordon Wesley said currently Alotau only has a load of 1.8 MW on average and up to 3 MW during peak hours.
“These new developments include a planned housing estate at Gehua, a waterfront super mall, expansion of the Hagita and Saint Barnabas Nursing College and an industrial hub at Ahioma.
We will need more power here on and I am pleased to partner with PNG Power, to give me that additional reliable and stable power supply for my province in the months to come,’ he said.
Mr Wesley also highlighted the efforts by the Provincial Administration on Climate Change and Green Energy, of which this Solar PV project does justification to this drive.
PNG Power chief executive officer,Obed Batia commended the Alotau Provincial Government, through the Governor, for the exemplary leadership and making MBPG the first province to fund a renewable energy generation facility purely to support the development of the province without pushing for any commercial returns.
“Under this arrangement, a hybrid solar farm will be built in the province to support the current power generation from the Alotau Power Station.
Once completed, Alotau town will have two power generation sources,” he said.
The Solar PV system will run to support the diesel during the day, battery for a couple of hours during the evening and then during off-peak hours at night, while PPL can use one or two of its generating units to keep the lights on till day break.
Mr Batia said the partnership is highly valued as there is no commercial arrangement between the parties, rather, an effort to make sure there is stable, reliable power supply to the growing demand of the province.
The project will take six (6) months from commencement to the test and commissioning of the Alotau Solar Power Project.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Papua New Guinea together with the National Government and the Autonomous Bougainville Government have launched US$4.4 million (K15.5 million) Bougainville Micro Solar Farms Project in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.The project supports the provision of renewable and reliable energy for a more sustainable and climate resilient future for the people of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.This project is part of the wider US$36 million (K126 million) “Enhancing Green Transformation in the Pacific towards Net-Zero Emissions and Climate-Resilient Development for Peace” project that the Government of Japan is funding to support four Pacific Island nations.
The “Green Transformation” initiatives will reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, drive sustainable economic growth and help them cope with the impacts of climate change.The four Pacific countries benefiting from this project are PNG, Samoa, Timor Leste, and Vanuatu.The project will leverage the expertise of UNDP’s Climate Promise portfolio to support each country to transition toward net zero and climate resilient pathways, in line with their commitments enshrined in the Paris Agreement, and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
Funded by the Government of Japan, the Bougainville Micro Solar Farms Project is designed to support the development of renewable energy options in Bougainville and reduction on reliance on diesel as the main form of energy in the region.The project will support the construction and commissioning of three micro solar farms in the north, central, and south regions of Bougainville with a total capacity of 1 megawatt (MW).It will also provide independent and neutral support to the two governments in the implementation of the post referendum process.
The Ambassador of Japan to PNG, Nobuyuki Watanabe said it was an opportune time to help support the green transformation in the Pacific and in particular PNG that relies heavily on fossil fuels to power much of its electricity generation.

Senegal and the French group Meridiam, which specialises in the financing and development of infrastructure, announced on Monday that they had signed a contract for the acquisition and management of electric buses in Dakar.
the initiative aims at reducing congestion in this West African metropolis.
The BRT (bus rapid transfer) project, on which work is underway, aims to provide Dakar with electric rapid buses from 2023 onwards, running on exclusive lanes between the suburbs and the city centre, over a distance of more than 18 km, a stretch where traffic is slowed down because of traffic jams.
The investment for the electric buses amounts to 127 billion FCFA (193.6 million euros), according to the Senegalese authorities. The total cost of the BRT project is more than 300 billion FCFA (€450 million) financed by donors such as the World Bank.
Senegal signed the contract with Meridiam and a consortium made up of the French state-owned companies SNCF and RATP, the French transport operator Kéolis and Fonsis, a Senegalese investment fund, said on Monday a statement from the Executive Council for Urban Transport in Dakar (Cetud), a body attached to the Senegalese Transport Ministry.
The 15-year concession contract covers ""the acquisition, operation and maintenance of rolling stock and BRT systems"". Meridiam announced ""the provision of a fleet of 100% electric buses, with batteries, including an initial fleet of 121"", in a separate press release. This is a concrete project in favour of energy transition that offers a solution adapted to the challenge of climate change, but also an effective alternative to the existing diesel bus network"", it said.
The BRT project also includes the construction of workshops and depots, more than 80 km of roads and pavements to be developed or rehabilitated along the axes served, including intersections, bus stops and terminals. It complements the regional express train (TER) running between Dakar and its suburbs, the first section of which was inaugurated in December.
The two transport systems, BRT and TER, which complement each other with feeder lines, aim to relieve congestion in Dakar, where 0.3% of Senegal's 17 million people live and almost all of the country's economic activities are concentrated. Traffic jams officially cost the city 152 million euros per year.

Earlier this week, Luanda and Kinshasa granted a group of investors a 30-year concession to operate the line linking the Angolan port of Lobito to Kolwezi, in the heart of the DRC's mineral-producing region.
The 1,700 km railway line was built 100 years ago by British investors.
The $555 million project, partly finance by the US, is expected to develop exports of copper ore and other products, boost regional trade and strengthen Angola's ties with Western countries.
The DRC is the world's leading producer of cobalt and Africa's leading producer of copper, two minerals used in the manufacture of solar panels and electric cars.
According to the Angolan operator, Vecturis, work should start within the next three months.
The consortium, which includes commodities trader Trafigura and Portuguese construction company Mota-Engil, hopes to reduce the journey time between the DRC and Lobito to less than 36 hours, with at least six trains a day over the next five years.

			PNG needs a mega plan in energy

Papua New Guinea will not be short of energy, particularly sustainable, renewable and cleaner energy forms.Anyone who has spent some number of years studying science, physics or engineering will know that.Yet, it is bewilders the majority of educated people in PNG why we continue to have power outages in the main centres like Port Moresby or Lae and other provincial capitals of PNG.
Why?Why are the abundant energy forms in PNG not harnessed to give us the power we need 24/7 and 365 days of the year?Answer: The decision makers, the Ministers and MPs and those in charge of the authorities and state-owned enterprises which deal with energy have not inked a proper plan to ensure that sustainable and reliable energy must be harnessed to supply all the major centres in the country and making diesel power redundant.
PNG will turn 50 years in 2025, and yet the power outages continue, not to mention water issues, and surprisingly the nation’s capital is one centre that falls victim to these issues.In Monday’s edition of your Nambawan Paper, it was reported that the power blackouts in Port Moresby may be a thing of the past as the Edevu Hydropower Project in Hiri-Koiari district in Central Province will soon supply the city with 50MW of power.The government partnered with PNG Hydro Develop Ltd with a support of K120 million. The firm is spending K650 million to develop the project.
That is wonderful news for Port Moresby and Central Province, but what about the many other urban centres of PNG which still depend on diesel fuel to provide power?Is there any mega plan to develop hydropower projects or solar farms in those centres so they can provide sustainable and cleaner forms of energy?The future though is not so gloom when we see certain MPs taking the lead to build their own power plants to ensure their district centres and headquarters have reliable power.Bulolo is a case in point. They are working on their Bayune underground power station.Local MP Sam Basil Jr in a March 1 report said “we say no to power blackouts in our district”.Such MPs must be supported by the government and all the state authorities to complete their projects. It is the way forward.Other MPs and Governors too must learn from such examples and start building their own power generation stations.They cannot just sit back and come complain in Parliament about power outages.They must be proactive and ask the government to assist.The government on the other hand must have its mega plan to support districts and provinces to build their own power stations to generate sustainable and cleaner forms of energy.On top of that, the use of diesel generators must be made redundant.That is the way forward.

                        Kenya
HydroBox Kenya, a hydroelectric power plant, stands as a testament to the vision of Kenyan entrepreneur John Magiro, the founder of Magiro Hydro Electricity, in partnership with Belgian equity investment company, HydroBox. 
With a total project cost of approximately Ksh 105.7 million (equivalent to $740,897.50 USD), the initiative received crucial technical and financial backing from prominent entities including the National Environment Trust Fund (NETFUND), the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA), and Belgium's FINEXPO.
Located in Murang'a County, the power plant now serves over 2,000 households, significantly contributing to the Kenyan government's rural electrification program. In 2021, a staggering 600 million Africans, comprising 43 percent of the continent's population, lacked access to electricity, with 590 million residing in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the urgent need for reliable power sources.
A key issue plaguing the region is frequent power outages, underscoring the importance of embracing renewable energy options like solar and hydro. Despite the potential, these sources remain underutilized.
HydroBox distinguishes itself as the sole hydroelectric power plant in Kenya's central region. It harnesses the energy of diverted water from a nearby river to spin turbines that generate electricity. The process initiates with the creation of a small reservoir, where water is channeled into a canal and subsequently directed through a pipeline to the turbine. This rotational motion drives an alternator that produces power, with the entirety of the water returning unaltered to the river, preserving environmental integrity.
Impressively, the plant has the capacity to generate up to 750 kilowatts of power, which is then distributed to an array of consumers, including households, educational institutions, and businesses. In case of drought or low river levels, the incorporation of solar panels ensures uninterrupted power supply.
John Magiro emphasizes that the water remains uncontaminated throughout the process, with 100 percent of it being released back into the river downstream.
Local residents like Grace Wairimu benefit greatly from this hydroelectric energy source, using it for various daily needs such as television viewing and phone charging.
Steve Maina, the CEO of the nearby Kiriti Tea Factory, has witnessed a marked improvement in production quality and consistency since adopting hydropower. Previously, power interruptions would compromise tea leaf quality and market prices, but with the stable supply, the factory can ensure consistent quality and maintain its reputation.
Azarius Karanja, of sustainability consulting firm Niko Green, underscores that smaller hydroelectric systems like HydroBox have limited negative environmental impacts, as they divert water for only a short distance before returning it to the river. The social and economic benefits, particularly in underserved, off-grid communities, often outweigh any potential drawbacks, making these systems a compelling model for energy access and development.
John Magiro provides insight into the plant's operation, detailing the water diversion process, which leads to the generation of 750 kilowatts of power supplied to various customers, including tea factories, businesses, schools, and local residents.
In summary, HydroBox Kenya, led by the visionary John Magiro, has emerged as a beacon of sustainable energy in the heart of Kenya. Through innovative water diversion and hydropower generation, it not only improves the lives of local residents but also aids businesses and schools while minimizing environmental impacts. It stands as a model for regional energy development and electrification initiatives.

                        South Africa
The industrial landscape of the northeastern province of Mpumalanga, an area known as South Africa's coal belt will soon be transformed.
The Komati power plant, once a busy coal plant that is now earmarked to be repurposed as a wind and solar power plant that will have batteries to store the energy the clean power generates, looks deserted with only security guards and cleaners on site.
Unlike other power stations in Mpumalanga where smoke bellows from the unit chimneys with coal trucks entering and leaving the plants, only one entrance at the Komati plant, which was first opened for business in 1961, is functional.
The country's worst blackouts have put the spotlight on the government's controversial energy transition strategy.
“These arguments about decommissioning power plants have come up, and while climate change is a significant issue and we do need to transition to lower carbon sources of electricity, we need to consider the need for an increase in electricity in general in South Africa,"" Julia Taylor, a researcher on Climate Change and Inequality at the University of the Witwatersrand said.
""So we need to continue to build out renewable energy but not start switching anything off until we have enough electricity to provide for basic needs in the country.”
The Komati plant's repurposing is a pilot project that will hopefully show the way for South Africa and the rest of the developing world’s transition to clean energy away from dirty fossil fuels.
The World Bank has provided a loan of $490 million for the plant’s repurposing.
The money is supposed to include the retraining of former plant employees, but it was unclear this week how much of this part of the project had already started.
The work related to repurposing the plant is yet to gather steam, with estimations that this may take up to five years.
In November last year, the last generation unit at the coal-fired power station which was generating about 125 megawatts of power was shut down.
Controversial funding modelThis week, the power utility Eskom invited bids for the implementation of a socio-economic plan to mitigate the effects of the plant’s closure, including the economic impact on the province of Mpumalanga and surrounding communities where the plant is located.
When developing countries are asked to prioritize green projects out of environmental concerns, various deals are proposed. The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JetP) financing model has raised questions. 
While $490 million is a large sum by any measure, a Researcher highlights that a large portion of this money is in the form of loans.
“There are a few questions that have been raised around the funding model associated with the JetP"", she says.
""And the first is, particularly from South African perspective, is that only 4% of the current amount that's promised is grants. So it's actually mostly loans and guarantees. And obviously, we're a country in a significant amount of debt.”
South Africa's president is attending a summit on climate and debt in Paris. Top on the agenda are changes needed in the way multilateral lenders grant money to developing countries which are often hardest hit by the climate crisis. The bodies have been criticized for not factoring this crisis in their decisions.
Lives soon turned upside down?The closest residential area near the Komati power plant is a small suburb, also called Komati, and most people here work at coal mines around the province.
The houses in there are well-built and old fashioned.
They used to be owned by the power utility Eskom during the apartheid era and were provided for white managers of the power plant. They were sold off to individuals after 1994, mostly high-earning workers at coal mines around the province.
The locals say most of the houses are now being rented out to contractors for the coal mines and trucking companies in the region. Groups of men were waiting around Komati, hoping to be picked up by contractors in trucks who provide them temporary jobs as gardeners or cleaners in nearby settlements. 
There is only one primary school and one shopping mall in Komati and everyone here depends on coal jobs to make ends meet.

                        South Africa
A South African town was forced to shut down part of its power-generating solar panels to comply with national grid's Eskom schedule of daily blackouts.
For the local energy distributor, wasting precious energy will have consequences for businesses.
3. SOUNDBITE 1 - Gugu Mokoena, General Manager of private electricity distributor, Rural Free State (female, English, 33 sec):
""The court refusing us or Eskom refusing us to continue with this. It means load shedding, and with load shedding, it means that the businesses won't have, some of them will have to consider closing shop because then they will be reliant on diesel which is expensive. And that will mean, that would mean job losses for the community of Mafube"", admits Gugu Mokoena, General Manager of private electricity distributor, Rural Free State.
Nationwide power cuts in South Africa can last up to 12 hours a day.Many businesses cannot afford the fuel to keep generators running for hours on end.
""We have lost chickens, it was cycle one, it was in January. I lost I think about five, not exactly, but it's plus or minus 5000 chickens, in both three houses. In a house it was a high mortality in house one, high mortality in house two, high mortality in house three due to load shedding"" said Gary Mbundire , Manager at a chicken farm in Frankfort.
Local residents and businesses started using locally produced energy from the solar power plant last February in a bid to mitigate the impact of nationwide blackouts imposed by Eskom.
""If they are not going to allow us to use the solar farm or to use our own electricity, we don't have any choice, we will have to take the law into our own hands and it's a matter of survival. We cannot, we cannot allow Eskom and NERSA (National Energy Regulator of South Africa, Ed.) to prevent us from solving the problem that was created by Eskom. They can't produce any electricity and we are not allowed to use the electricity that we produce. It doesn't make sense"", threatened local farmer Hans Pretorius. 
South Africa's leading opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, accused Eskom of acting ""like a village bully"" in this case, preferring to protect its monopoly to embracing additional generation capacity.

                        South Africa
Residents living near one of South Africa's largest coal-fired power stations fear their livelihoods will be at risk if the power station is closed or repurposed as part of South Africa's transition from coal to cleaner sources of electricity like solar and wind.
As one of the world's biggest polluters due to its heavy reliance on coal to produce electricity, South Africa's plans to phase out its coal-fired power station in favour of green energy.
It recently secured at least $8.5 billion in funding to repurpose the coal-fired power plants to renewable energy sites producing solar and wind power.
The plan has been welcomed and is being funded by western countries including Germany, U.S and the UK.
It was widely endorsed at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt where the country signed agreements for some parts of the loan funding.
The country's first power station to be decommissioned, Komati Power Station in Mpumalanga, is targeted for repurposing for solar and wind power generation.
Located about 2km from the Duvha Power Station, Masakhane township is home to thousands of residents, with many having migrated from various parts of the country to settle closer to the power station in search of economic opportunities.
The community is also located on the backdrop of Mooifontein and Wolvekrans open-cast collieries, which supply tons of coal to the power station.
The primary sources of income for community members are directly and indirectly linked to coal mining and the 3600 megawatts power station, ranging from transportation and food industries to contract work inside the power station. They continue to use coal on a daily basis for cooking and heating.
Selby Mahlalela moved from his Nelspruit home in the same province of Mpumalanga to Masakhane in 2006, and has been doing various jobs as contract worker for the power utility Eskom since then, doing maintenance-related jobs.
""It is the one place that the majority of people from here rely on for job opportunities, despite them not being permanent workers. This happens a lot especially when there are shutdowns or maintenance work. The people get to have some,"" said Mahlalela.
But the transition remains a contentious issue, even within President Cyril Ramaphosa's cabinet.
This week, energy minister Gwede Mantashe told lawmakers that the transition to cleaner energy should not happen at the cost of people's livelihoods and the country's energy security.
""I am one of the people who say, we can have a transition. But that coal is not about just numbers, it is about human beings. It is (about) ten towns in Mpumalanga,"" said Mantashe.
Silindile Kheswa is among those who have benefited from short-term contract work and skills development by working at the power station, and fears the transition may spell the worst for those not able to get jobs in renewable energy projects.
""Some of our brothers are involved in the trucking of coal, transporting it to various power stations. So if you are saying no more coal, that means we can't put food on the table,"" said Kheswa.
The Duvha power station is one of the 15 coal fired powered power stations operated by the power utility Eskom. and has faced many breakdown recently, contributing to the country's rolling power blackouts.

                        Tunisia
In Tunisia, the first floating solar station on a lake next to a Tunis industrial park has started to operate.
The expectation is that the 200-kilowatt project from a French renewables company, Qair, can be a prototype for bigger projects nationwide.
""When we started at the time, it was the first project in Africa for a floating solar power plant, i.e. in the water. The originality of this project means we can use water instead of taking up land that can be used for other things like farming or homes"", said Omar Bey, executive for the French-based renewables group Qair.
Using floating solar panels helps to conserve water resources whilst making the panels more energy efficient.
""Floating solar panels first of all allow the reduction of water evaporation when they are installed on a water body. So this evaporation of water in countries like Tunisia, Which is water-stressed, certainly allows the dams to keep more water reserves"", concluded the executive. 
In 2015 Tunisia set ambitious targets for renewables but last year green sources accounted for only 2.8 percent of the country's energy mix and the rest came from natural gas.
""We're blessed with a lot of sunshine in Tunisia, and it's not like in other places such as the Gulf, the solar panels have the characteristics and the sunshine is good, and we can exploit it, so why not let everyone put up solar panels? The field is developing and will keep on doing so"", said Hassen Amiri, manager of Sater Solar energy company.
Tunisia's neighbour, Morocco, is leading in the region. The country currently produces around a fifth of its electricity from clean sources.

By NELSON JOETHE Eastern Highlands province has embraced the workshop on renewable energy projects amid prolonged power supply fluctuations during this prolong dry spell.Administration teams from Obura-Wonenara, Kainantu, Henganofi, Okapa, Lufa, Unggai-Bena, Goroka and Daulo districts, including one from the Eastern Highlands Provincial Administration, attended the workshop that was funded by the United Nations Development Program and facilitated by the Climate Change Development Authority.
Funding security, technical design and proper construction planning, land issues, lack of consultation and awareness on the proposed projects and guarantee for sustainability were identified as some of the main challenges they would face in those energy projects.Some of the projects they have identified include revival of Komoyiufa hydro and Goroka solar projects in Goroka district, Megabo hydro, Korofeigu solar panel and biomass projects in Unggai-Bena district, Kivirinka hydro project in Henganofi district and construction of Gotuni mini hydro project whose feasibility study was already completed, and others.The CCDA officers Jeal Chris and Minando Baro are assisted by a consultant to UNDP, Wilfred Amai, to run the workshop.
They have assured the participants that the funding sources for those projects were reliable and challenged them to identify mega projects that would benefit everyone with rippling effects across the districts and throughout the province.The participants were told that they would go through a simulated feasibility study for a model project today in order for them to do an effective plan for the potential energy projects they identified.The participants encouraged each other to identify mega energy projects. They have tentatively identified the Korofeigu solar panel project in lower Bena and a site where the Asaro river, Bena river, Henganofi river and a tributary from Mt Michael in Lufa district meet as a potential hydro project that can turn more than 10 turbines before they flow out to meander along with Kikori and Purari rivers in Gulf province.

                        Algeria
**Algeria is full of renewable energy promise.  Host to significant hydrocarbon resources, the country also wants to play a role in the energy transition in Africa, mainly thanks to its photovoltaic potential. **
A land full of solar-powered promiseIn the Sahara desert, in the Laghouat region, 240,000 solar panels make up the El Kheneg solar power plant, with a capacity of 60 MWp. The energy produced here, covers about one seventh of the region's needs.
Completed in 2016,  the project is a prototype and part of the country's transition, aimed at preserving fossil fuel ressources and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Houari Mahi is the head of engineering of Sonelgaz Energies Renouvelables, he explains to Euronews Algeria's potential regarding solar energy.
""Algeria has 3,000 hours of sunshine per year, and in the case of Laghouat, it is estimated at 1,800 hours per year. This is enough to push us to invest in the construction of photovoltaic structures. We need to generate the same amounts of simple megawatts or kilowatt-hours with photovoltaic sources as we do with fossil fuels.""
To diversify its energy mix, largely dominated by gas and oil, Algeria wants to achieve 15,000 MWp of solar energy by 2035. A call for tenders is underway to install solar power plants in several regions.

National scale Photovoltaic experiementsThe region of Laghouat is at the forefront of this conversion: solar kits have been distributed  to remote villages and to nomadic populations.
In the town of Aine Madhi, headquarters of the Tariqa Tijaniyya, a Sufi brotherhood, here too the transition to renewable energy is underway. On the roof of the Koranic school, opposite the mosque, a solar water heater has just been installed. 
Initiatives are also multiplying across the city: from solar powered petrol stations to solar powered street lights.
This technological integration is seen as a positive step in the right direction by many,  including Mohamed Akmi, director of Soltech.
""People come to ask questions about the benefits of renewable energy. And they are moving in that direction. God willing, we will move from fossil fuels to renewable energy,"" he says.

And that is not all, in the North of Algeria lies Oran, the country's second largest city, and it's airport.  
The airport's new terminal, with a capacity of 3.5 million passengers per year, is partially powered by more than 4,500 solar panels on the huge roof. 
""This is a green terminal. The airport manager runs 11 airports in the west and southwest. We have a lot of sun here in Oran and in the southern airports there is even more sunshine. In the near future, we aim to equip them with renewable energy as well,"" says  Nadjib Benchenane, director of the Ahmed Ben Bella Airport.

The possibilities fueled by green hydrogen
In Algiers, researchers are working on another promising lead, that of hydrogen, presented as an energy of the future.  
Algeria has signed a partnership with Germany. The aim is to produce and then, maybe export the highly-demanded green hydrogen via the pipelines that run to Europe.
Hydrogen is produced by electrolysis. Electrolysis requires electricity. In Algeria, we can produce renewable energy at very low costs, so the hydrogen will also be low cost. Hydrogen can also be produced by other means, for example thermal methods. Now, the other advantage of Algeria is the great solar thermal potential. We can produce hydrogen with processes that use little or no water, at prices that are competitive.

                        RESEARCHER AT THE CENTRE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY (CDER)
Pilot projects are being studied to produce green hydrogen while respecting the Saharan environment. Large-scale experimentation could begin as early as 2030.

                        South Africa
For years, students in a South African township have seen their parents struggle to use trains for daily commutes, the railways frequently hobbled by power outages and cable thefts.
To respond to the crisis, a group of 20 teenagers invented South Africa's first fully solar-powered train.
Photovoltaic panels fitted to the roof, the angular blue-and-white test train moves on an 18-metre-long (60 feet) test track in Soshanguve township north of the capital Pretoria.
Trains are the cheapest mode of transport in South Africa, used mostly by the poor and working class.
""Our parents... no longer use trains (because of) cable theft... and load shedding,"" said Ronnie Masindi, 18, referring to rolling blackouts caused by failures at old and poorly maintained coal-powered plants.
The state power company Eskom started imposing on-and-off power rationing 15 years ago to prevent a total national blackout.
The power outages, known locally as load-shedding, have worsened over the years disrupting commerce and industry, including rail services.
Infrastructure operator Transnet has struggled to keep rail traffic flowing smoothly since the economic challenges of the pandemic fuelled a surge in cable theft.
By 2020, rail use among public transport users was down almost two-thirds compared to 2013, according to the National Households Travel Survey with many commuters turning to more expensive minibus taxis.
Masindi said they decided to ""create and build a solar-powered train that uses solar to move instead of (mains) electricity"".
The journey has not been without its challenges.
A lack of funding delayed production of the prototype locomotive, and the government later chipped in.
""It was not a straight line,"" said another student, Lethabo Nkadimeng, 17. ""It was like taking a hike to the highest peak of the mountain.""
The train, which can run at 30 kilometres (20 miles) per hour, was showcased at a recent universities innovation event.
For now, the prototype can run for 10 return trips on the track installed on the grounds of a school.
It will be used for further research, and eventually presented as a model the government could adopt.
Fitted with car seats and a flat-screen TV to entertain passengers, it took the students two years to build.
""What we have realised is, if we you give township learners space, resources and a little mentorship they can do anything that any learner can do around the world,"" said Kgomotso Maimane, the project's supervising teacher.

BY MELISHA YAFOIPNG Power Limited is embarking on building 17 new hydroelectric power stations in the coming years.Chief executive officer Obed Batia said this drive is part of its reform to expand its grid networks in the country and will be working closely with the State and donor partners to deliver this project.
Mr Batia said PNG Power will embark on a hydroelectric scheme that will add 17 new hydro power stations by 2027, equivalent to about 100megawatt of hydroelectric power which the government and bilateral partners are assisting PPL with the feasibility studies to make this project a reality.He said this during his presentation at the recently held PNG Energy Summit in Port Moresby on Wednesday.Mr Batia highlighted that PPL is looking seriously to consider the move from diesel to renewable energy. He said the use of gas is important in this transitional step at least to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
“PNG Power has worked with Government and bilateral partners to expand the network while adding new connections through existing network of the electrification program.“There are several projects underway as a result of the rural electrification project, including donor projects such as the hydroelectric donor power projects, rehabilitation, grid expansion and the recently announced power sector development project which will increase the household connections,” he said.“PPL supports the government’s effort to reduce greenhouse gas emission…We’re encouraged to convert from fossil fuel generation to clean sustainable generation such hydroelectric power, solar and wind energy.
“The sun is one of the few source of energy that attracts little operational costs, we must find ways to develop and find large scale solar projects to rehabilitate existing hydro electrical project and build new hydro system to service our economy.”

Undersea power cable to connect Egypt to Europe via Greece

 Le tracé du projet d’interconnexion de l’Europe avec l’Egypte via la Grèce appelée GREGY

How can Europe manage to secure abundant and cheaper electricity? 
One of the most ambitious projects in the planning is the interconnection of Europe with Egypt via Greece.
An undersea cable that will carry 3,000 MW RES electricity and connect northern Egypt directly to Attica in Greece. 
The project has been undertaken by the Copelouzos Group, whose management met last week with the Egyptian leadership to speed up the procedures
""By bringing 3,000 MW of clean energy to Europe, via Greece, we are helping Europe wean itself off Russia's fossil fuels and natural gas. Also, the green energy we will transport will be much cheaper than today's energy prices. You understand that this will help both Greek and European consumers"", said Ioannis Karydas,  CEO of Renewables, Copelouzos Group.
The so-called ""GREGY interconnection” is a 3.5 billion euro project that has been categorized as a Project of Common Interest (PCI) by the European Union. 
It will carry clean electricity produced in Egypt (or other African countries) through solar or wind parks.
""Approximately one third (of the electricity that will come from Egypt) will be consumed in Greece, and mainly in Greek industries, another third will be exported to neighboring European countries and one third will be used in Greece, for the production of green hydrogen. The majority of this hydrogen will also be exported to neighboring European countries"", added Ioannis Karydas.
Egypt has completed interconnections with Libya, Sudan and Saudi Arabia and aspires to become a major energy hub for SE Europe too.
The ""GREGY interconnection” is expected to be operational in 7 to 8 years.

                        Mauritania
The production of renewable energy is increasing in Mauritania.
According to the UN Agency for Renewable Energy (IRENA), the location of the country make it ideally suited for solar and wind power.
The agency estimates that the energy potential amounts to 4,000 Gigawatt-hours.
The capital, Nouakchott, is served by four power plants, including a 30-megawatt wind power plant, as well as a solar farm.
""The estimated total annual energy is approximately 115 Gigawatt-Hour. It depends on the month. The most favourable months are April to May when we can produce up to 13 Gigawatt-Hours. And sometimes there are less favourable months (when we produce) at approximately 5-6 Gigawatt-Hours,"" says Nourou Dia, controller at Nouakchott Wind Power Plant.
This wind power plant and the solar farm produce 10-15 percent of the capital's electricity.
""Through the development of Mauritania's significant potential in renewable energy, whether solar or wind. In 2018, we were at 38% of renewable energy in the energy mix and we intend to increase (this share) to 50% by 2030,"" says Marieme Bekaye, Minister of Environment and Sustainable Development.
In 2018, Mauritania emitted less than one tonne of CO2 per inhabitant, more than 15 times less than the US and five times less than the UK.
Mauritania is already preparing for next year's negotiations that are scheduled to take place on the continent.
""So the COP27, which should be held at the end of next year in Egypt, we consider that it will be the COP of Africa. The African continent with the group of negotiators must play a really important role in this and so there will be a whole series of preparatory meetings in advance. COP27 will work on Glasgow's shortcomings at COP26."" promised  Bekaye.
Mauritania is home to less than 5 million inhabitants. 
According to Somelec, the country's electricity company, just 54 percent of the population is connected to the power grid.

Kenya: government unveils plans for nationwide e-bike scheme

                        Kenya
The Kenyan government unveiled plans to roll out electric motorbikes across the country on Friday.
President William Ruto announced the initiative with African startup Spiro just days before he hosts the first Africa Climate Summit in the Kenyan capital Nairobi next week.
About two million motorbikes are on the roads in Kenya, he said, mostly ""boda bodas"" or two-wheeled taxis that are commonly used across the continent.
""The adoption of electric mobility is a high-priority intervention to address the challenges of pollution, adverse health effects, and fuel costs,"" Ruto said.
Kenya, he said, aimed to eventually phase out the combustion engine-powered motorbikes, warning that the increasing use of such vehicles across the continent had ""serious implications"" for climate change and air quality.
Although Africa contributes only two to three percent of global greenhouse gas emissions, it suffers disproportionately from climate change, according to the UN Environment Program.
Spiro said it has already introduced nearly 10,000 electric bikes in Africa to countries including Benin, Togo, Rwanda, and Uganda.
It said in a statement it plans to set up 3,000 battery-charging and swapping stations in Kenya, in addition to 350 already across Africa, with a planned rollout possibly of more than one million electric vehicles throughout the country.
Ruto, who has positioned himself at the forefront of African efforts to combat climate change, said Kenya had the potential by 2030 to generate 100 percent of its energy from renewable sources such as hydroelectric, geothermal, solar and wind power, from more than 90 percent now.
Kenya generates most of its energy from renewable sources such as hydroelectric and geothermal power.
But the country suffers from frequent power cuts.
A massive outage last weekend left several regions without electricity for hours, including Nairobi and its international airport, which was plunged into darkness after a generator serving the main terminals failed to work.
Fuel prices at the pump have recently soared to their highest levels in more than a decade, adding to the economic hardship of Kenyans suffering from a cost-of-living crisis and a raft of new taxes.
Currently, the number of registered electric vehicles (EVs) accounts for less than one per cent of the total 4.4 million registered vehicles, according to government figures.

A FLIGHT from China carrying equipment worth millions of kina for the Edevu hydro power plant in Central Province, will touch down in Port Moresby on Sunday.
The flight will come from Shenzhen city in Quangdong province, a Chinese embassy official said.
He said the private sector consortium behind the power project are keen to get the project up and running as soon as they can, and as such, have invested a lot of money to transport the equipment by a chartered SF Airlines cargo flight instead of the traditional sea transport route.
The power project, located west of Port Moresby, will have the capacity to reach 54 megawatts of power, and can supply up to 40 percent of the electricity to the Central and NCD regions after being connected to the national grid.
The reservoir impoundment ceremony of the project was staged early this year by the Chinese ambassador to PNG Zeng Fanhua and Prime Minister James Marape.
Speaking at the ceremony, Mr Zeng said the power project adopts a model of commercial investment and operation, demonstrating Chinese enterprises’ confidence in PNG’s long-term development and investment environment.
“Electricity supply is one of the key infrastructures that is critical to the economic development and improvement of people’s livelihood in every country,” he said.
“We have noticed the commitment and great efforts of the PNG government, led by Prime Minister Marape, towards the goal of achieving 70% electricity supply coverage for the total population by 2030.
We are confident that the Government is fully capable of achieving this goal, as the country not only has natural gas reserves but also abundant clean energy resources such as hydro and solar power.
Chinese companies have world-leading technology and solar power, as well as in power grid construction.”
Chinese companies are able and willing to contribute more to PNG in achieving the aforementioned electricity supply goal.

                    Interview
On this special interview segment on Africanews, UNICEF goodwill Ambassador Vanessa Nakata. The Ugandan climate activist plays an instrumental role in amplifying African voices in the climate crisis global conversation. 
You were recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and before that last year you were in Sharm el Sheikh for the U.N. Climate Conference. Did you hear anything that made you believe world leaders are keeping the pace on climate action?
Vanessa Nakate: Well, thank you. I can talk about the COP 27, which is in Egypt. One thing that we saw was the establishment of a 'loss and damage fund'. But it's important to know that that fund is still an empty bucket. And we need real money in the fund to help communities that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis. And when it comes to the World Economic Forum, honestly, most of the perspectives at Davos come from the West. Global issues are talked about from a Western perspective. 
Problems like the energy crisis are talked about from the perspective of businesses and families in Europe and North America. And yet lower income countries are suffering from multiple crises at once. Economic problems such as high debt burdens amidst several times worse after extreme weather events. So for me, the experience at Davos and the experience at seven, it points out how, you know, the communities that are on the frontlines of the climate crisis are still not on the front lines of these discussions.
You know energy poverty is one of many issues Africans are grappling with on a daily basis in your home country. You launched the Vash Green Schools Project, which aims to install solar panels in remote areas. What has the impact been so far and what are the challenges?
Vanessa Nakate: The Vash Green Schools Project is one that has started in 2019 to bring solar panels and clean cooking stoves to schools in Uganda, because I believe that no option is too small to transform the world. And as I speak right now, we've done installations in 33 schools impacting about 11,000 children. 
But this is a project that is grassroots, led by activists and organised by activists, young activists. But we need more resources, real systematic change from our leaders to be able to transform the work, to be able to address issues of energy, especially in the countries that are already suffering energy poverty for decades.
We may not love this fact, but generating electricity and energy emits carbon dioxide gas. Industrialised economies rely on that in Africa and the global South at large. Many countries are told to abandon projects out of environmental concern. Still, they are not the biggest carbon polluters. How do you think they can fairly industrialise without their resources?
Vanessa Nakate: Well, I can say that clean energy is the only investment that makes sense right now, especially when you look at the impact of the climate, you know, the impact of the climate crisis in so many communities. You know, there is no excuse. We've seen that fossil fuels have caused this crisis that has left, for example, 30 million people on the brink of starvation in the Horn of Africa. 
And these same fossil fuels have caused the air pollution that kills 8.7 million people around the world every year. So we see the challenges of investing in fossil fuels. The U.N. Secretary general, Antonio Guterres, said that the business models of fossil fuel companies are inconsistent with human survival. The IEA has clearly said that if we want to limit global temperatures below 1.5 degrees, then we cannot have any new fossil fuel investment. 
So I believe that the pathway of true development to development means protecting people and also having the economies, having people protected, having ecosystems and the planet protected. It's one thing to see economic development while people are being left suffering, you know, while the planet is being destroyed. So for me, that investment that we need not only across the global South, but across the world is clean and renewable energy.

                        United Kingdom
Climate protesters in London on Wednesday demonstrated outside the UK headquarters of French energy giant TotalEnergies against a controversial oil project in Uganda and Tanzania.
The planned East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) will see Ugandan oilfields developed and crude piped to the Tanzanian port of Tanga on the Indian Ocean. 
The project has been strongly criticised by rights activists and environmental groups and has also faced criticism in the European Parliament. 
In September, four environmental groups took legal action against TotalEnergies on claims of ""climaticide"", saying that the company ""must no longer continue to knowingly, freely and with impunity fuel climate change"".
The groups - Darwin Climax Coalitions, Sea Shepherd France, Wild Legal and Stop EACOP-Stop Total - say that TotalEnergies is liable for charges including destruction, damage or deterioration of property belonging to others likely to create a danger to persons, and failing to deal with a disaster.
Human Rights Watch in July urged a halt to the project, saying the project has ""devastated thousands of people’s livelihoods in Uganda and will exacerbate the global climate crisis"".
In a damning report, HRW said EACOP ""will displace more than 100,000 people, has caused food insecurity and household debt, caused children to leave school, and is likely to have devastating environmental effects"".
TotalEnergies says that those displaced by the project have been fairly compensated, and measures have been taken to protect the environment. 
The project involves drilling around 400 oil wells in Murchison Falls Nature Park, a biodiversity reserve and Uganda's largest national park.
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has vowed to proceed, saying the East African country's economy will benefit from the project.

BY LORRAINE WOHIPAPUA New Guinea will soon be moving away from non-renewable fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy as more developments take shape in the country’s energy resources projects.Internationally, there is a move away from non-renewable fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.
Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited managing director Wapu Sonk said PNG is following the same trajectory and over the next decade, new solar, hydro and geothermal power generation projects will be initiated by organisations such as Kumul Petroleum, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Santos, Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and others.As a way forward of identifying PNG’s vision and strategies of developing the energy industry, the country will host its fourth National Petroleum and Energy Summit in September.The main purpose of the summit is to provide an avenue for national and regional stakeholders in the petroleum and energy sector to meet and exchange ideas and propose projects in this sector.
Mr Sonk said the summit also comes at an opportune time given that TotalEnergies have just recently announced the Front End Engineering Design (FEED) for the Papua Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project which will once again bring PNG to the attention of the international LNG community.Mr Sonk said the nature of PNG’s main centres is that power generation is stand-alone diesel powered and therefore it will take time to develop renewable powered mini-grids or extend the PNG Power grids to such communities.“I see that the LNG is a key transition fuel in PNG and elsewhere, less polluting than diesel/HFO and gas is something that the country has plenty of and will be available from the PNG, Papua and P’nyang LNG project.
“In the much longer-term I see that hydro projects in PNG will be able to produce a lot more electricity.“This can absorb and we will in fact be an exporter of energy to the rest of the world as green hydrogen or ammonia grows,” Mr Sonk said.

                        Mozambique
Energy companies may return to Mozambique following the improvement of security conditions in Cabo Delgado.
The poverty-stricken northern province had been suffering increasingly violent attacks by Islamic State-affiliated insurgents since 2017, many targeting towns and communities near the $20bn gas export terminal, which is backed by major international investors and companies.  
The fossil fuel project has been blamed for stoking the insurgency in the north of the country, which has left thousands of people dead and displaced hundreds of thousands.  
Despite the military advances, the head of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) mission in Mozambique, (SAMIM)  Mpho Molomo, said it was too early to declare the end of terrorism in Cabo Delgado.
According to Molomo, attacks and atrocities against women and children are continuing in the forests where they are hiding.
In addition to the SADC, the government in Maputo has the support of a military contingent from Rwanda.
For José de Oliveira, a researcher for energy affairs at the Catholic University of Angola, the conditions are beginning to be met for the return of multinational companies to Cabo Delgado. 
""The pressures on Mozambique and the support that can be given to Mozambique to solve the situation of military and social insecurity, I think will bear fruit, because Moçambique is a country right now with the biggest reserves to be developed, there are not many gas reserves but so the biggest concentrated ones are in Mozambique.""  
With the energy crisis caused by Russia's war in Ukraine, Europe is looking to Africa for alternative sources of liquefied natural gas.  
""Given that natural gas is going to be a transition fuel and will last many more years than oil, and given the importance that LNG is now assuming in the world, I am convinced that the projects in Mozambique will be successful,"" says de Oliveira.  
Lawyer Alexandre Chivale does not have the same optimism regarding the gas exploration zones in Mozambique, despite a new law approved by the parliament.  
""There is a risk that through these attempts to fight terrorism and money laundering could hurt rights and guarantees and freedoms of the citizen,"" he says.  
On May 19, the Mozambican parliament approved the law to reprehend, combat and prevent terrorism. 
But public opinion is divided over its possible limitations on press freedom and freedom of expression.

In Rwanda, KivuWatt transforms gas from 'killer lake' into electricity

                        Rwanda
The engineers aboard the floating power station on Lake Kivu could only watch nervously as the volcano in the distance erupted violently, sending tremors rumbling through the water beneath them.
It was not the lava shooting from Mount Nyiragongo last May that spooked them, but the enormous concentrations of potentially explosive gases within Kivu, one of Africa's great Rift lakes lying between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.
Flanked by rolling green hills tumbling into glassy waters, Kivu is not quite the picture of tranquility it seems, according to Francois Darchambeau from KivuWatt, a company that extracts gas from the lake's waters for electricity.
Thousands of years of volcanic activity has caused a massive accumulation of methane and carbon dioxide to dissolve in the depths of Kivu -- enough to prove monumentally destructive in the rare event they were released.
If triggered, a so-called limnic eruption would cause ""a huge explosion of gas from deep waters to the surface"" resulting in large waves and a poisonous gas cloud that would put the lives of millions at risk, said Darchambeau, environmental manager at KivuWatt.
""This is what we call a killer lake,"" the limnologist, or an expert in freshwater systems, told AFP.
Only three such lakes exist in the world: Kivu, and Lakes Nyos and Monoun in northwest Cameroon.
The latter two experienced limnic eruptions in the 1980s, and the bigger disaster at Nyos suffocated more than 1,700 people in a toxic release of carbon dioxide.
But these catastrophes occurred in a rural area, whereas some two million people would be ""at risk"" of such a similar disaster involving Kivu, said Darchambeau.
In both Rwanda and DR Congo, many live in fear of the lake's harmful potential, and stories abound of swimmers disappearing into its depths after being asphyxiated or pulled under.
- World first -
The lake, however, poses both peril and promise.
KivuWatt, which says this is the only project of its kind anywhere in the world, saw an opportunity to tap these abundant gases for energy generation.
A 20-minute speedboat ride is required to reach KivuWatt's unique floating platform, a compact tangle of pipes and buoys as high as a multi-storey building moored in the Rwandan part of Kivu.
With a deafening roar, the facility pumps water saturated with carbon dioxide and methane from around 350 metres (1,150 feet) to the surface.
As it rises, the water and gas separate as the pressure changes.
""It is like opening a bottle of soda,"" said KivuWatt director Priysham Nundah, who described the project as ""halfway between a thermal and a renewable energy plant"".
The extracted methane is sent through a pipeline to a second facility located onshore in Rwanda, where the gas is transformed into electricity.
The carbon dioxide is pumped back into the lake at a precise enough depth to ensure the delicate balance is not upset.
The company says it hopes that removing methane could over time reduce pressure within the lake, possibly lowering the risk of a limnic eruption.
- 'It was frightening' -
But fears of such a disaster were reawakened when Nyiragongo -- an active volcano north of Kivu in DR Congo -- roared to life in early 2021.
The lava flow killed 32 people and destroyed hundreds of homes, as earthquakes shook the region. A second wave of lava pushed deep into the earth under the lake itself.
From their station, KivuWatt's engineers watched the sky turn red and angry.
""It was very frightening,"" said Nundah.
""When the rates of earthquakes and the frequency of earthquakes started to rise... no one could really say what would happen.""
A shutdown was considered -- but the engineers held their nerve.
Suspending operations would have serious consequences for Rwanda: KivuWatt produces around 30 percent of the annual electricity consumed in the East African nation.
American company ContourGlobal, which owns KivuWatt, launched the Lake Kivu venture in 2015 and for a time considered expanding its capacity from 26 to 100 megawatts.
Another company is exploring the possibility of launching its own 56-megawatt gas extraction venture on the lake. There are no plans in the short term for such a project on the Congolese side.
How long it will take to deplete these vast gas reserves will depend on the pace of extraction, said Martin Schmid, a researcher at the Swiss Institute for Water and Environmental Research.
""Just with KivuWatt alone it will take, I don't know, centuries to have really a reduction of methane in the lake,"" he said.

                        Egypt
Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said Tuesday that his country and Russia are on ""a new brilliant page"". He made the comment during a foundation laying ceremony for Egypt's first nuclear plant.
El Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant will be built with Russia’s state nuclear energy corporation Rosatom.
El-Sissi said during the ceremony that El Dabaa will represent another positive development in Russian and Egyptian relations.
He referenced the global energy ""crisis"" and supply chain issues as reasons for ""reviving Egypt's peaceful nuclear program.""
""It contributes in providing safe, cheap and sustainable energy that helps in reducing our dependency on fossil fuel and avoiding the fluctuation in its prices,"" he added.
Russian President Vladimir Putin emphasized his country's commitment to modern industries and bilateral cooperations.
""We will contribute to the creation of modern industries, qualified jobs, and the solution of social issues. We will do this together, since the new energy system allows us to do all this. This is truly a flagship project in the best traditions of our bilateral cooperation,"" Putin said during the ceremony via video-link.
Putin also said he was in ""constant contact"" with the Egyptian leader Abdel Fattah el-Sissi.
""In particular, we exchange opinions and coordinate stances in connection with the tragic development of the situation in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,"" Putin said.
A senior Egyptian official recently said Egypt and Qatar, which have brokered past agreements between Israel and Hamas, are developing a multi-stage proposal to try to bridge gaps in the process.
The proposal would include ending the war, releasing the hostages and putting forth a vision for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Putin also highlighted Russia and Egypt work on the creation of a Russian industrial zone in the Suez Canal area.
He also said Russia supported the desire of Egypt to become a full member of BRICS, the intergovernmental organization comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates.
El-Sissi said during the meeting that the foundation laying represented a ""new brilliant page on the path of close cooperation between Egypt and the Russian Federation"".

                        Nigeria
French energy giant TotalEnergies is ready to invest $6 billion (around €5.5 billion) over several years in Nigeria's energy industry, particularly in gas and offshore projects, the Nigerian presidency has said.
""We are ready to invest $6 billion over the next few years. We are looking in depth at more opportunities for deepwater and gas production,"" said TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanné, according to a presidential statement.
On Monday, Head of State Bola Ahmed Tinubu held talks with Mr Pouyanné in Abuja, the capital.
""Everything is in place. We just need to finalise the adjustments and changes needed to unlock the exceptional potential in oil and gas"", continued Mr Pouyanné, according to the Presidency.
Nigeria is ""very important"" for TotalEnergies, which accounts for between 8% and 10% of the group's total oil production, according to the CEO quoted in the press release.
For his part, the Nigerian president pledged to ""remove all obstacles in the oil and gas industry"". ""We are ready to work with you"", he said.
The oil and gas major indicated that it ""has a substantial portfolio of projects that could represent 6 billion dollars of investment over the next few years"".
Ten days ago, the Nigerian president's office announced similar commitments from British oil and gas giant Shell, for USD 6 billion in offshore, natural gas and liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects.
Since his inauguration at the end of May, Bola Ahmed Tinubu has taken a series of economic measures aimed at attracting more foreign investment to this oil-producing country and member of OPEC.
A law, the Petroleum Industry Bill, adopted in 2021 after years of debate and delays, was already aimed at attracting more foreign investment in the oil sector through changes to regulations, royalties and taxes.
Nigeria has seen its oil production decline in recent years due to widespread pipeline theft, attacks, high operating costs and red tape, which have deterred investors.

The three-day Papua New Guinea Resources & Energy Investment Conference held in Sydney, Australia will end today.Prime Minister, James Marape in his keynote address on Monday acknowledged the collaboration with the private sector and the positive mergers and transitions that have occurred in the likes of Newmont, Telstra, Santos, and others that have invested in Papua New Guinea despite global uncertainties.Mr Marape when reflecting on the country’s economic growth journey in the resource sector, said that the significant role played by oil and gas companies, as well as mining companies, deserves applause.“The transformative impact of projects like the PNGLNG project led by ExxonMobil has been monumental. It doubled our economy, demonstrating the positive outcomes of strategic investments in the resource sector,” he said.Highlighting the importance of finding a balance between national interests and investor interests, Mr Marape said Papua New Guinea remains committed to providing a conducive environment for investment while ensuring a fair return for both parties.“The fiscal stability agreements in place underscore our commitment to consistency and reliability in the business environment.“The lineup of upcoming projects, including Porgera, Papua LNG, P’nyang, and Wafi-Golpu further underscores the potential for growth and collaboration,” he said.PNG Chamber of Resources & Energy president Anthony Smaré in his opening remarks said the 17th PNG Resources & Energy Investment Conference is the biggest one held yet, catering for an expected 1500 attendees, over 90 exhibition booths with a dynamic program featuring 102 speakers over three and a half days.Mr Smare said the conference is traditionally held in Sydney, due to ease of access of international attendees to travel to Sydney compared to holding this conference in PNG or other locations, and due to Australia traditionally being an important source and gateway of investment into PNG.

                        Uganda
A court in Uganda on Friday dismissed claims by dozens of families who felt they had been wronged when they were compensated for the use of land used to develop a TotalEnergies oil megaproject, an activist and a plaintiff said.
The court in Hoima, a town near oil fields, ruled against 42 families claiming inadequate compensation, according to an activist from the Tasha Africa Research Institute, which is covering the villagers' legal costs.
""The ruling was in favor of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development,"" Abdul Musinguzi told AFP. ""No further compensation is planned"", he added.
One of the plaintiffs, Jealousy Mugisa Mulimba, described the ruling as an ""ambush"". ""We were given one day to prepare the case after receiving the summons on December 4,"" he said. ""These are mostly poor, illiterate people. Only 12 people went to court today because the others couldn't afford the transport.""
This vast project by the French group, which was the subject of a $10 billion investment agreement with Uganda, Tanzania, and the Chinese company CNOOC, calls for the drilling of 419 wells in western Uganda and the construction of a 1,443 km pipeline to link them to the Tanzanian coast.
It is presented by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni as an economic boon for his landlocked country, where many inhabitants live in poverty. However, it is strongly opposed by environmental and human rights groups.
The project and TotalEnergies are also the subject of a complaint in France for acts that, according to the associations, amount to ""climaticide"".
In September 2022, the European Parliament expressed concern about ""human rights violations"" against opponents of the project in Uganda and Tanzania, and asked the French group to study ""the feasibility of an alternative route that would better preserve protected and sensitive ecosystems and water resources"".
TotalEnergies asserts that the people displaced by the project have been fairly compensated and that environmental protection measures have been taken.

                        Mozambique
Mozambique has recently greenlit a groundbreaking energy transition plan set to span until 2050, with the goal of securing investments totaling approximately $80 billion.
The comprehensive strategy aims to propel the nation towards a more sustainable future by enhancing renewable energy capabilities and ensuring wider electricity availability.  
President Filipe Nyusi is slated to formally present the ambitious energy plan to the international community on December 2nd during the COP28 climate summit in Dubai. The plan, approved by Mozambique’s Council of Ministers on November 21, outlines crucial initiatives set to unfold between 2023 and 2030.
Key components of the plan include a substantial increase of 2,000 megawatts in hydropower capacity achieved through upgrades to existing facilities and the completion of the Mphanda Nkuwa Hydropower Project. Additionally, the strategy emphasizes the expansion of the national electricity grid and a significant transition to electric vehicles to mitigate emissions in the transportation sector.
Mozambique, which marked its entry into the liquefied natural gas market in November 2022, envisions that substantial gas discoveries, combined with the untapped potential of renewable energy, will serve as catalysts for economic growth. The implementation of this energy transition plan aligns with the country's broader objectives of driving development and uplifting millions from poverty.

The Revenue Protection Project (RPP) team at PNG Power is hopeful of generating more revenue for the company.The revenue or recovery team has come out strategically with concepts that will see crack down on illegal electricity users.With additional manpower to an existing six team, more visitors will be knocking at clients’ doors at any time.The team hopes to identify 1000 electricity users before the end of December, 2023, according to the PPL management. Thirty-six electrical linesmen have undergone an intensive three-day training on professional conduct and meter readings. General Manager-Retail, Kingston Albert has applauded his team for their consistent thriving to identify offenders.“PNG Power has faith in you for your commitment and competency. That is why the company has invested on its employees,” Mr. Albert said. PNG Power has supported the retail unit with ten new vehicles. Out of them, five were assigned to other groups in the same business unit. Recently, the RPP received their five vehicles, according to Acting Chief Executive Officer, Nehemaiah Naris.The RPP has been without manpower for quite a period of time and with the recent internal recruitment of news staff to the project, the team is now equipped to full swing. The team will be dedicated to four corners of the National Capital District under the new exercise called: Meter Boxing.Mr Naris is confident of the team and said Port Moresby has the largest number of Electricity users and this team would identify and generate income for the company. “These are our existing customers who have already connected into our systems but we are not realising the full revenue potential from our customers that is why we will have to go back and check each one of our customers,” he said.

Germany pledges to invest in green energy projects in Africa
                                                      German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (C) and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, front second left, arrives at the G20 Investment Summit on Nov. 20, 2023.
                                                                                    -

                        Germany
The German government pledged Monday to invest 4 billion euros ($4.37 billion) in African green energy projects until 2030.
Scholz discussed the pledge at a news conference on the G20 Compact with Africa summit taking place in Berlin. He did not mention any specific projects but said the materials used in green energy should be processed in the African nations they come from.
“This creates jobs and prosperity in these countries,” Scholz said. “And the German industry gets reliable suppliers.”
Compact with Africa is based on an initiative launched by Germany during its chairmanship of the Group of 20 leading rich and developing nations. It aims to improve the economic conditions in the participating countries in order to make them more attractive for foreign private investment.
Scholz said Germany should become a long-term and reliable partner to countries in Africa.
“Africa is our partner of choice when it comes to intensifying our economic relations and moving toward a climate-neutral future together,” he said.
The Compact with Africa countries include Egypt, Ethiopia, Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Guinea, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo and Tunisia, according to German news agency dpa.
Asked about China's strong presence in Africa, several African leaders said the continent was open to other partnerships.
“Perhaps China was more audacious, perhaps they have more vision and perhaps they trusted the potential in Africa,” Moussa Faki, the chairperson of the African Union Commission, said.
“The African continent is open to different partnerships,” he added. “Our wish is for you to place your trust in us, to impose less conditions and to create the conditions together. ...
“Improving governance, that’s our responsibility, and therefore this shared vision could allow, I’m certain of it, for a large capital that could be invested in the continent,” Faki said.

Member for Kikori and Minister for Provincial and Local Level Government Affairs, Soroi Eoe made his stand clear to support Total Energy and other developers who are there for the resources in Gulf province.
Minister Eoe said this during the presentation of three dinghies by the Papua LNG Project late last week in Napanapa, Central Province.
Minister Eoe said, “As a State Minister, I’m here to support Total Energy or any developers to ensure that development projects are delivered as expected and utilized in the best interest of the people. 
“In the context of Papua LNG, I’m looking forward to do that because it is the most important project that is coming our way.”
He also said he is looking forward to seeing the development of the project in his province.
“It is important for me and I’m looking forward to organise developing the project.”
Mr Eoe acknowledged Total Energies PNG Ltd for donating much-needed dinghies to serve the people in the affected areas.
“We have many resources in our country and we need developers to come and help us develop those resources,” he added.

The world’s leading gold producer, American gold mining Company Newmont Corporation, will for the first-time feature at the 17th Papua New Guinea Resources and Energy Investment Conference and Exhibition as a Principal Premium Sponsor.
The conference will be held on 10-13 December 2023 at the Sydney International Convention Centre under the theme ‘PNG Resources and Energy: Promoting Sustainable Investment’.
Newmont Corporation formally closed its acquisition of Newcrest Mining Limited, owner of the giant Lihir Gold Mine and 50 per cent owner of the Wafi-Golpu copper-gold development project, earlier this month, and today announced that it will be backing the Conference in the top sponsorship category as a Premium Principal Sponsor. 
A Newmont spokesperson stated: “Newmont Corporation is pleased support this premier industry event to showcase to the world that Papua New Guinea is an important investment destination.
“Newmont recently acquired Newcrest Mining Limited, which included its operations in Papua New Guinea – the Lihir gold mine and the joint venture with Harmony Gold in the Wafi-Golpu project. 
We look forward to building a strong and mutually beneficial partnerships with the government and people of Papua New Guinea to generate lasting shared value and meaningful economic development through the world-class Lihir gold mine and the highly prospective Wafi-Golpu gold and copper project.
“As the world’s leading gold company, we recognise Papua New Guinea’s significant, untapped economic potential and support providing its citizens the opportunity to invest in and benefit from our operations, projects and social contributions.
“Newmont has taken steps to establish a dedicated Business Unit in Papua New Guinea with the appointment of Alwyn Pretorius who has assumed the role of managing director and will be based in Port Moresby. 
Newmont has also established a secondary listing of Newmont stock depositary interests on the PNGX from the closing of the transaction.
“Newmont looks forward to future collaborations with the Chamber and other industry bodies to drive investment in PNG.”
PNG Chamber of Mines and Petroleum President Anthony Smaré said: “We are delighted to have Newmont to come on board as a headline sponsor for this conference. 
As the biggest gold miner, and a major partner in PNG’s economic development now and for years to come through its involvement in the Lihir gold project and the Wafi-Golpu project, Newmont have a strong message to share about their belief in PNG as an investment destination, and their contributions to PNG and I am happy that they are participating. 
This year’s conference is anticipated to be the biggest investment conference held with over 1500 attendees with four floors of the Sydney International Convention Centre reserved for the four days duration of the Conference.
“The conference will be opened by PNG Prime Minister James Marape, and features a program designed to promote investment in resources and energy sector, as well as the non-resources sector, the event is anticipated to draw an unprecedented number of attendees.”

                        United Arab Emirates
The United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP28, is due to get underway in Dubai at the end of this month.
Nearly 40 oil and gas companies sent delegations to last year's summit which aimed to move the world away from burning fossil fuels like oil and gas.
Ironically, some might say, the UAE appointed Sultan al-Jaber, chairman of the nation’s oil company, as president of this year’s edition of the talks.
Faced with criticism about their presence at negotiations, oil and gas companies claim they are actively taking part in the transition to renewable energies.
News agency, Associated Press (AP), conducted a review of how much these companies invest in green energies, along with the priorities laid out in their annual reports.
It says it doubts that oil and gas companies are genuinely committed to a transition to renewable energies.
“After looking closely at all the oil companies that attended last year's conference, we came to the conclusion that for the most part, they don't have large energy transition plans,” says Peter Prengaman, AP’s climate and environment news director.
“Many are token, many are not discussed at all. And some that are discussed in detail really rely on things like hydrogen production, carbon capture, things that are developed but far from scale. So we could argue that these are really not green energy transition projects,” he said.
The bulk of the investments worth billions of dollars, by companies the AP reviewed, are in further exploration, extraction, and refining of oil.
In some case, these plans are over the next decades, long beyond when scientists say the world must move away from fossil fuels.
“These companies plan to keep oil and gas at the centre of their business for the most part. That is who they are. And most don't plan to fundamentally change what is at the core of their business,” says Mary Katherine Wildeman, AP’s climate and environment data reporter.
And the AP says that, in notes to their investors, some of the companies strike a reassuring tone about the durability of fossil fuels.
Prengaman says that while there is a real push for them to make the transition, and to use their capital and know-how to do that, they get a lot of pushback from shareholders.
“You see that in the rollback of some of the most ambitious plans, because shareholders look at it and say, hey, that means you're going to make less money over the next 5 years, 10 years, and we've got to ramp up production.”
The review also found that most of the companies only have small, if any investment in solar or wind power, the most established green technologies.

			Kainantu request transfer of Ramu 1 hydro project

The Kainantu district development authority will request for the transfer of the Ramu 1 hydro project.Chairman and local MP William Hagahuno said this depends on the Ramu 2 hydro project.He said if the construction work on the Ramu 2 project does not progress to its completion in time to complement the currently operating Ramu 1 hydro project to generate and provide electricity supply to the up-coming Wafi-Golpu gold project in Morobe Province, they will ask for the transfer of the Ramu 1 hydro project to the host districts of Kainantu and Obura-Wanenara.“This is our position,” Mr Hagahuno announced at the launching of the avocado project at the government station on Friday and expressed dissatisfaction that they have been kept in suspense despite queries on the delay on the construction work on Ramu 2 project to proceed.“I have been raising queries on the delay on Ramu 2 hydro project in the Parliament and on several occasions, but a lot of politics seems to be involved.“If they want private power producers to serve our citizens, natural and corporate, then we might as well ask the government to give us the Ramu 1 hydro project so that we can all become independent power producers to serve our people.”The deputy prime minister John Rosso has assured his support for the Ramu 2 hydro project at the launching of the Kainantu district five-year development plan in September, after Mr Hagahuno queried the ownership of the proposal for a gas-powered private power producer to be the energy source for the Wafi-Golpu gold project and who the beneficiaries are.In August at the launching of Obura-Wanenara five-year district development plan, the Prime Minister James Marape had confirmed the State Enterprise Minister William Duma’s assurance at the launching of the Lufa five-year district development plan that Eastern Highlands and Morobe provincial governments will equally share 40 per cent of the Ramu 2 hydro project 25 years after its operation.However, Mr Hagahuno, said the delay of the construction work on the Ramu 2 hydro project is concerning, especially after the Eastern Highlands and Morobe provincial governments have already signed a Memorandum of Understanding at the beginning of this year in relation to the Wafi-Golpu gold project which, he said, is awaiting the developer to enter into power purchase agreement with the PNG Power.He pointed out the importance of power source in view of the existing resource projects such as the Bilimoya underground gold project in Agarabi local level, Hidden valley and the upcoming Wafi-Golpu gold projects in Morobe, Kumbukari Nickel mine in Madang and other potential resource projects in the provinces, apart from fish factories and other industries in Lae and Madang, all of which need electricity to operate.He said it is time they claim recognition for their participation in the development of PNG through hosting of the Ramu 1 hydro project since its operation.

			Gembogl’s hydropower project drilling starts

GEOTECHNICAL drilling and investigation has begun.
This is for the Gembogl Hydropower Project feasibility study under the Kundiawa Gembogl district administration and civil engineering company AG Energy.
Kundiawa-Gembogl MP Muguwa Dilu said besides the feasibility study for the hydropower project, the District Development Authority has also engaged SMEC to also conduct a feasibility study to construct a high voltage Transmission Line to both PNG Power Limited’s (PPL’s) Kundiawa- Mirane sub-station and the Yandera Mine site for possible power transmission.
He said the landowners have granted their full support through an MOU executed between the development partners last month.
The MP said Michael Aglum from Kongun Consulting Ltd, a leading consulting company dealing with land matters in major project sites in PNG, has also been engaged to undertake the social and environment impact assessment.
“The project is progressing smoothly. SMEC expects to complete the feasibility study report at the beginning of 2024.
The project will advance to the power purchase agreement negotiation and FID in the second half of 2024.” he added.

			PNG Power chair fears oversupply

With the country facing power issues, this has led to the construction of more hydropower projects and that can cause oversupply says PNG Power Limited Board Chairman McRonald Nale.
“We don’t want to be faced with a situation where everyone is venturing into hydropower projects and there is oversupply.
“So, with that we have to be very careful because everybody has been building hydro and that costs money and so we need to assess the present demand, asses the future demand and then we can allow the Independent Power Producers (IPP)to come in,” he said.
Mr Nale said at this stage, Morobe needs more power especially with the Wafi-Golpu project coming up.
“It’s (Wafi) a confirmed 100 plus megawatts and the nine megawatts to be produced by Bapa hydro is not enough,” he said.
Mr Nale said the current supply on the grid is not enough and that Wafi should look at partnering with PPL to supply the project with power.
“As far as Morobe is concerned with the Wafi-Golpu project, the current leadership of Morobe should seriously look at tapping into PNG Power for us to supply them,” he said.
He said green energy like the hydro project is environmentally friendly and should be considered also in other parts of Morobe.
Mr Nale made these statements during the launch of the Bapa hydro power project in Buang local level government in Bulolo district, Morobe Province last Friday.
He thanked the landowners for allowing the developer, AG Energies Limited for agreeing to develop the project.
Chairman of Kwasang Incorporated Land Group in Buang where the hydro is being built has praised AG Energy for seeing their need and working together with their late MP Sam Basil Sr to bring the project in for the people’s benefit.
“Thank you landowners for your patience and understanding and now a milestone have been achieved.
“To our villagers, please look after this project so that it will look after us in the next years to come,” the chairman said.

			Duma commends contractor on Edevu project

State Owned Enterprise Minister William Duma has commended Allan Guo and company for his commitment and effort in seeing the Edevu Hydro project kick off.
On Sunday night, the Edevu hydro project, under the contract of AG Contractors – Mr Guo and his team, an inaugural charter carrying about 100 tonnes of equipment for the power project.
Duma thanked Guo for his commitment and said that he was truly a genuine partner for the Government and especially PNG Power Limited.
“What we have been talking about and discussing has now come to reality – on this occasion, due to the seriousness and importance of electricity in our important city, Allan Guo has gone out of his way to make this thing happen.
This is not the first time Allan Guo has helped our country,” Duma said.“He has proven to be our genuine partner in terms of PNG’s energy security.
“Allan and his company had managed to put their hard earn money with the shareholders without demanding a guarantee from the government.
“All they wanted was some assurance that PNG Power would purchase power when this project became a reality. And of course PNG Power trusted him, our genuine long-lasting partnership with a private investor and our own energy company PNG Power.
“If we want to change our country it has to start in Port Moresby. There is no space for continuous unexplained power blackouts, there must be zero tolerance and if we can have an investor like Allan Guo and his company where they provide their own funds without the guarantee and build a first class hydro project in the mountains of Koiari, how can we go wrong.

PNG Power is undertaking major maintenance work to improve power generation, transmission, distribution and reliability within the Port Moresby Grid.
PPL’s Port Moresby Power Grid Development Project is to maintain power reliability, quantity and affordable electricity supply to its customers in Port Moresby and parts of Central province.
Maintaining quality and reliable power supply security is one of the core focus areas of PNG Power.
Port Moresby’s Central Business District is one of the main target areas.
Two new 11kV Express Feeder lines will be constructed, which will take power from the new Kilakila substation, relieving the current supply from the Konedobu substation.
Work will be completed by the end of 2023.
Four additional feeders from the Kilakila substation will connect to the existing grid to relieve loads from the Konedobu and Boroko substations.
There will also be a dedicated feeder to supply Port Moresby General Hospital from the new Kilakila substation.
The construction work started on 1 st August-2023, and poles have been constructed from Butuka to the Sabama junction and will continue into the CBD via Ela Beach.
The Town area is a major load centre in Port Moresby, with increasing energy demand from building developments in the CBD, Paga Hill and Pom Port Redevelopment.
This grid reinforcement and upgrade work is expected to significantly reduce outage time and improve power reliability in the central business hub.
The Port Moresby Power Grid Development Project includes five other grid improvement projects.
These include the rehabilitation and upgrade of the Rouna-1 hydropower station from 5.5MW to 7MW output and the refurbishment of Sirinumu hydropower station to 1.4MW.
The rehabilitation and upgrade of these power stations will increase PPL’s renewable energy generation by up to 13 per cent.
The completion and energising of the new Kilakila substation on 13th July 2021 includes and associated two 66kV transmission lines and bus-bar arrangements, one from Rouna-2 to Kilakila substation and then, feeding into the Boroko substation via the Six-Mile area.

Construction of vital power dam in Niger halted due to sanctions
                                                      Kandadji hydroelectric dam, Niger

                        Niger
The construction of the $800M Kandadji hydroelectric project in Niger has been halted by the Chinese contractor Gezhouba Group which claims that most of its funds have been frozen due to the current sanctions after the coup.  
In a letter dated 7th August, the group said it would halt operations and lay off its workforce. They added that they will re-deploy workers again if finances are secured.
The dam, upon completion, is expected to boost the country’s grid by 50%.
Niger’s population has experienced a vast lack of electricity with only 4.3 million people having access to energy as 90% of its population uses wood as a source of energy.
The recent sanctions by the regional Economic Community of West African States ECOWAS has cripple Niger’s economy with donor and other multinational organizations cutting off their links.
The dam was also expected to help control the Niger River which will make downstream irrigation possible during the prolonged dry seasons.
Its construction was under discussion since the 1970s.
The dam was expected to be completed in March 2026 and produce over 130MW of electricity that would be distributed both internally and in the neighboring countries.

Zimbabwe president opens 600MW coal-fired power plant

                        Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Thursday inaugurated a Chinese-funded power station that he said would go a long way in easing power shortages ahead of national elections.
Mnangagwa, 80, who is seeking a second presidential term on August 23, has been on a ribbon-cutting spree as he attempts to portray himself as a go-getter and reassure voters about the state of the economy.
He opened a coal mine on Monday and a clinic on Wednesday, before heading to the northwestern town of Hwange to officially launch the 600MW coal-fired power plant on Thursday.
Analysts expect a tense vote later this month, amid a crackdown on the opposition and a disaffected population battling hyperinflation, poverty and high unemployment.
Addressing supporters at a local stadium after the opening, Mnangagwa said the new plant would be ""a critical enabler of development"", adding Zimbabwe was ""open for business"".
The landlocked southern African country has for years been reeling under severe power shortages that at their worst late last year left millions of people in the dark for up to 19 hours a day.
The government declared a sudden end to blackouts in July although most people still experience daily outages lasting a couple of hours.
The new power station also allowed Mnangagwa to show he still has good friends in the international arena, where Zimbabwe is largely isolated.
The plant, the expansion a pre-existing station, is one of four energy projects undertaken with a $1.2 billion loan from China, with which Harare has ties dating back to fight for independence from Britain.
""China is always ready to help Zimbabwe to achieve its goal to uplift its people,"" Chinese ambassador Zhou Ding told the stadium rally.
Zimbabwe can't access financing from international lenders like the IMF and World Bank due to payment arrears and is the target of western sanctions over graft and rights abuses.
Mnangagwa has long blamed the punitive measures for the country's dire straits -- something the United States and Europe deny.
In Hwange he told supporters Zimbabwe would now be self-sufficient in its power needs and the government would continue to focus on growing the economy ""by thinking outside the box"".

Activists demand climate action as TotalEnergies annual general meeting kicks off
                                                      Activist Patience Nabukalu, who heads 'Fridays For Future in Uganda', protested in Paris on May 26, 2023.
                                                                                    -

Demonstrators gathered Friday (May 26) in Paris outside of the building hosting the annual general assembly of French energy giant TotalEnergies.
Bellowing slogans such as ‘tax the wealthy’, climate activists wanted to keep pressure on the company to reduce its carbon footprints.
The head of Fridays For Future in Uganda had made the trip. Total is jointly developing an oil project in the country.
""I've moved all the way like over 5.000 miles to come to the Total AGM because it's important to people like me,"" Patience Nabukalu said.
""I'm so grateful that I'm the voice to the voiceless, a person who can fight for their communities, because our leaders have just proven to us that they are not. They don't care about the people, but rather the profits.""
Protesters accused Total of crime against humanity as many fear new fossil fuel projects will prevent the world from limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius in line with climate goals set in Paris in 2015.
Speaking inside of salle Pleyel, TotalEnergies CEO defended the company's strategy.
""I would like remind everyone that the global demand for oil is growing even if TotalEnergies didn not meet this demand, others will do so for us,"" Patrick Pouyanne told his audience.
""Even though we can act -and we do act- on our customers' demands by diversifying our ever-evolving energy offers towards lower carbon energies""
The company wanted to avoid the chaos of last year when activists prevented some shareholders from attending the annual meeting.
This year, the firm placed two-metre (6.5-foot) high plexiglass screens to separate off speakers on stage from members of the public at the concert hall.
It also forbade attendees and journalists from using their smartphones inside the venue.
Climate campaigners are growing impatient with big polluters over their impact on the planet.
During the annual shareholders' meeting of British group Shell on Tuesday (May 23), activists sang ""Go to hell Shell!""
Energy giants posted record profits last year as the war in Ukraine broke out.

                        Uganda
Around forty environmental activists and religious figures chained themselves together on a footbridge over the Seine in Paris Thursday, protesting TotalEnergies' megaprojects in Uganda and Tanzania.
Opponents say the French energy giant's $10 billion East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) will harm biodiversity and take land from more than 100,000 people without adequate compensation
""We are doing damage to biodiversity here with all the motorways that continue to be built in France. But we are doing even more damage because we're talking about an extreme scale with this EACOP project and other investments elsewhere in the world,"" said Caroline Ingrand-Hoffet, a pastor.
The activists chained themselves to the Leopold Sédar-Senghor footbridge, blocking the way for almost 25 minutes, 1,443 seconds to be precise, in reference to the 1,443 km of the future East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP), a project of the French multinational that they are contesting.
The action took place on the eve of a TotalEnergies annual general meeting of shareholders.

                        Zimbabwe
The Australian oil company Invictus Energy announced Monday the discovery of a hydrocarbon deposit in the north of Zimbabwe, a country which suffers from massive energy cuts.
Analysis of the samples confirms the presence of petroleum, helium and ""high quality"" natural gas, the company said.
The Australian company has reassessed the data from a study carried out in the 1990s by the American oil giant ExxonMobil (ex-Mobil) which had abandoned its project on this site located 240 kilometers north of the capital Harare.
Invictus Energy signed an agreement in 2018 with Zimbabwe that provides for production sharing with the government as the country suffers massive power cuts of up to 19 hours a day.

                        Mozambique
The Mozambican president, Filipe Nyusi, assured on Wednesday that the conditions are met to allow TotalEnergies to resume its huge natural gas exploitation project in the country, suspended since 2021 following a major jihadist attack, a few kilometers away.
The poor but resource-rich northeastern province of Cabo Delgado, which has a Muslim majority and borders Tanzania, has been plagued by violence from armed groups since late 2017. Nearly 4,700 people have already been killed, including more than 2,000 civilians. One million have been forced from their homes.
At the end of March 2021, a coordinated attack on the coastal town of Palma forced the French group to suspend a 16.5 billion euro natural gas development project until further notice. Facilities still under construction on the Afungi peninsula were evacuated.
""The cooperation and coordination with Total is very good. The working environment is conducive for the company to resume operations at any time,"" said Filipe Nyusi, speaking at a mining and energy conference in the Mozambican capital Maputo.
TotalEnergies has been cautious for several months about the possibility of restarting its operations in Mozambique. Its CEO, Patrick Pouyanné, visited the country in February and held talks with the Mozambican president.
Last month, the French giant's Italian subcontractor, Saipem, announced preparations to resume work, saying it had been informed that ""safety has improved.""

BY MAXINE KAMUSPort Moresby’s power blackouts may now be over.After 15 years, the National Government and its Chinese partner PNG Hydro Development Limited formally launched the Edevu Hydropower Project located along the Brown River area outside Port Moresby.
The company PNG Hydro Development Limited has invested K650 million in the project which is one of Central Province’s biggest assets that will supply electricity not only to Port Moresby but the whole Southern region in the near future.The government has partnered with the developer of the project by way of K120 million for a 132KV transmission line from Edevu to Port Moresby which is already under construction, on top of the K650 million spent by the company.PNG Hydro Development Ltd managing director Allan Guo said it took them almost 15 years to reach the launch of the project and this was possible through the good relationship and discussions they had with the landowners of Edevu.
He said it is a private investment without any guarantee from the Government because they believe that their investment will greatly have an impact on the lives of the people and country as a whole.Prime Minister Marape James (pictured) thanked the developer for having trust in PNG and privately funding the project.Mr Marape said it’s a wonderful reflection of an investor, who saw this opportunity thousands of miles away, and had faith in PNG. He said Edevu landowners had done, by going into partnership with a foreign investor, was a good example for traditional landowners in the rest of the country.
“You have shown a wonderful example to other landowners right across our country.You (landowners) own 97 per cent of land rights. My Government, as governments of past, and any government into the future, will not break that right you have. It is your inherent, God-given right to your land.“But land sitting idle is of no use to us, or more importantly, our children and their children that will come into the future,” Mr Marape said.The Sirinumu Dam and its Rouna 1, 2 and 3 stations are the main suppliers of electricity to Port Moresby and surrounding areas.However, years of neglect and usage has led to many of the equipment being worn out, resulting in constant blackouts in Port Moresby.Also a growing population places a huge demand on power uses which results in overloading.The PNG Power Limited has also raised concern in the past about illegal power connections.

BY MARCIA NEGRIThe National Capital District Commission is seriously looking into secondary options to cure water and electricity woes in the city with their eyes fixed on a bore water project and the Edevu Hydropower Project.Recently, NCD Governor Powes Parkop and City Manager Ravu Frank visited the Edevu Hydropower Project located at the Brown River, approximately 47 minutes northeast of Port Moresby, which they applauded, noting it will be a reliable and cost-effective energy supply to NCD and Central Province.
Edevu Hydropower Project will generate 54MW of power is expected to go online two months from now.“Port Moresby needs reliable, cheap and constant power supply for domestic needs and, more importantly, to industrialise our city.The economic growth of the nation’s capital requires reliable affordable energy,” Mr Parkop said.
This visit follows a recent presentation of a bore water project by NCDC at the cost of approximately K1 million remains the top option to address widespread lack of access to safe water in the nation’s capital.During this presentation Mr Parkop urged Moresby Northeast MP John Kaupa, Moresby Northwest MP Lohia Boe Samuel and Moresby South MP Justin Tkatchenko to invest in the bore water project for their people’s benefit.“Water for me is an essential. Imagine our people without water.
I cannot be allowed to continue.This is a basic need and this is our capital city. We have to change that dynamic.If you agree, let us look for funds.You three put in some money and I top it up and we rock and roll.”For this bore water project, chairman for National Gaming Control Board, Clemence Kanau, committed K300,000 to the project which will be divided equally among the three districts.

                        Senegal
For years, residents of the small fishing town of Saint-Louis in Senegal have been struggling. Climate change, foreign industrial trawlers and the COVID-19 pandemic have made it hard to earn a living on the water.
When officials announced a new gas project off the coast in 2015, the community was hopeful it would bring new opportunities. Instead, many locals say, the gas has only brought a wave of problems and pushed people to desperation. That includes forcing some women to turn to prostitution to support their families, they told The Associated Press in interviews.
Four women who shared their stories said they started working as prostitutes because their husbands, all fishermen, could no longer make a living after the gas deal came to town and the rig restricted access to fertile fishing areas, known locally as diattara. The women all said they knew of several other women in the same position.
The women spoke on condition of anonymity because their families do not know what they do. Prostitution is legal in Senegal, but the women do not want to register, citing cultural shame.
For them, prostitution is faster and more reliable than working in a shop or restaurant — jobs that do not pay well and can be hard to find.
The deal — planned by a partnership among global gas and oil giants BP and Kosmos Energy, and Senegal and Mauritania’s state-owned oil companies — is expected to produce around 2.3 million tons of liquified natural gas a year, and Mauritania and trying to benefit the wider economy by locally sourcing products, developing the workforce and supporting sustainable development.
More than 3,000 jobs in some 350 local companies have been generated in Senegal and Mauritania, according to BP. The company also cited its work to renovate the maternity unit at the Saint-Louis hospital and its help of 1,000 patients with a mobile clinic operating in remote areas.
In a statement, Kosmos spokesman Thomas Golembeski, said the project will provide a source of low-cost natural gas and expand access to reliable, affordable, and cleaner energy. He also cited access to a micro-finance credit fund established for the fishing community.
“I pray that this ends, because it’s not what I want to do from the bottom of my heart. I do it for my children,” one mother said, her shoulders hunched and voice weary in a hotel room where she would not be seen by her husband or friends.
Traditionally, many women make a living processing fish, while the men catch it; sons, husbands and fathers spend weeks at sea. But with the restrictions, families could not feed their children or pay rent.
In some cases, families had to pull their children out of school or switch them from private to public schools where the teachers don't show up for days.
BP and Kosmos did not respond to questions about the women turning to prostitution.
They also did not respond to questions about whether they stood by their initial risk assessment of the project, which acknowledged in a 2019 environmental and social impact assessment that there were “a lot of uncertainties around the consequences for Saint-Louis fishermen” but still considered the intensity of the impact to be low.
The local government said people's concerns about the rig were overblown and that the community needs to be patient, at least until after production, which is expected to start by the end of this year.
Papa Samba Ba, the director of hydrocarbons for Senegal’s Petroleum and Energy Ministry, said the objective is that by 2035 half of all gas projects will go to local companies and services.
Local officials have acknowledged an increase in prostitution in Saint-Louis, but they attribute it to economic woes and widespread poverty in general — not directly to the gas project.

BY JOAN BAILEYRamu 2 Hydropower Project is set to be delivered through a public private partnership investment model at a total cost of US$940 million (about K3.2 billion).Kumul Petroleum Holdings executive manager, William Baglme revealed this during his presentations at the energy seminar held in Lae last week.
The project site is located on the border of Morobe and Eastern Highlands provinces.Mr Baglme said this project is one of the government’s largest impact projects delivered this year and scheduled construction time for Ramu 2 is six years.He said based on an international tender process, a Chinese Consortium, comprising Shenzhen Energy Ltd and Sinohydro Corp Ltd (Project Co), were awarded the project as the private sector partners to develop Ramu 2.
“The Government approved PPP (public private partnership policy) structure is a Build Own Operate Transfer (BOOT) model, where the Project Co finances, builds, owns, and operates the hydropower plant,” Mr Baglme said.“The Project Co sells the contracted volume of power to PNG Power Limited at an agreed tariff for a term of 25 years of which the contracted capacity is 50 per cent of rated capacity.”Mr Baglme said the government has outlined strategies on how the PPP structure of BOOT model will work at the end of the 25-year term, Project Co will transfer the asset at no cost, debt free and in good condition to the State.
He said all key state agencies are aligned to implementing project, including the host provincial governments of Eastern Highlands and Morobe signing a memorandum of understanding to allow the Ramu 2 to go ahead.“KCH has been working diligently with the responsible State agencies over the last 18 months to complete the work required to satisfy the government conditions precedents and get the project to financial close,” Mr Baglme said.“Based on progress to date, the government conditions precedents are on track to be completed within the year.”Mr Baglme said the government condition precedents includes issuance of the environmental permit by Conservation and Environment Protection Authority, permanent acquisition of land for the project from the Department of Lands and Physical Planning, registration of all impacted incorporated land groups on both the Eastern Highlands and Morobe sections of the project, signing of power off-take agreements with mines on the Ramu 2 grid and the issuance of a State guarantee to guarantee the project financing.

A Ugandan NGO wishes appeal in French courts in the near future after losing a case against TotalEnergies last month.
The Chief Executive of African Institute for Energy Governance (AFIEGO), Dickens Kamugisha, said NGOs are consulting with lawyers and project affected persons (PAP) in the case of the pipeline in Uganda.
- The February Case -A French court on had dismissed a landmark case against TotalEnergies for a massive oil project in Uganda and Tanzania after several NGOs filed a suit to suspend the controversial project.
It was the first case of its kind in France, and activists had hoped it would set a legal precedent to halt projects deemed harmful to the environment and human rights.
Six NGOs that filed the suit argued the development of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) failed to adhere to a ""duty of vigilance"", a 2017 law that compels companies to avoid grave harm to human rights, health, safety and the environment.
The court in February ruled the case was ""inadmissible"", saying the plaintiffs did not correctly follow court procedures against the French energy giant.
It said the plaintiffs submitted accounts to the court in December that were ""substantially different"" from those that were presented to TotalEnergies in a formal notice in 2019 when the case was initiated.
The suit was brought by two French and four Ugandan NGOs, which accused TotalEnergies of taking land from more than 100,000 people without adequate compensation.
They also said the company drilled wells in the biodiversity-rich Murchison Falls National Park on the shores of Lake Albert.
Friends of the Earth and Survival, the two French NGOs, and the Ugandan groups denied having substantially modified their submissions to the court.
They ""only clarified them and consolidated their arguments with more than 200 documents of supporting evidence"", said Juliette Renaud, a campaigner with Friends of the Earth.
The plaintiffs, who can appeal against the decision, said they would speak to ""the affected communities"" about their next steps, Renaud added.
Celine Gagey, the lawyer who represented the NGOs, said they would take time to ""digest the decision"" and discuss whether it would be best to appeal.
The ""very strong popular mobilisation"" over the project ""obliged Total to improve the transparency of its actions"" and make further efforts which remain insufficient, she added.
- Economic boon -TotalEnergies welcomed the ruling.
It said the verdict recognised the firm had ""formally established a vigilance plan"" with elements ""sufficiently precise to not be regarded as cursory"".
The $10-billion oilfields and pipeline project has been hailed by supporters as an economic boon for Uganda and Tanzania, where many live in poverty, but is strongly opposed by environmentalists.
The project is being jointly developed by TotalEnergies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), along with the state-owned Uganda National Oil Company.
The 1,443-kilometre (900-mile) pipeline will transport crude from vast oilfields being developed in Lake Albert in northwestern Uganda to a Tanzanian port on the Indian Ocean.
Lake Albert, a natural border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, lies atop an estimated 6.5 billion barrels of crude, of which about 1.4 billion barrels are currently considered recoverable.
Tanzanian Energy Minister January Makamba this month rejected the environmental and rights concerns as ""propaganda"", saying the country complied with environmental, safety and human rights standards.
The ruling in France is the first instance of the ""duty of vigilance"" being tested in a courtroom.
Several legal proceedings for failure to comply with the ""duty of vigilance"" are underway against other French companies, including Casino, Suez, Yves Rocher and BNP Paribas.

There are mixed feelings among villagers in Uganda who will be impacted by French energy giant TotalEnergies’ controversial Tilenga oil field project.
An estimated 5,551 people will have to move off their land to make way for the $10 billion oilfields and pipeline project in Uganda and Tanzania.
The company says 93 per cent of those who have to be relocated have signed compensation agreements. Some got cash for land, while others were moved to new homes or were offered training.
Jackson Adubango has been affected by the project but said that it is changing some people’s lives for the better in his village.
""The first impact that I’ve seen, the young people in the village who were not going to school, they stayed at home and life was hard for them. But right now, because of the project, they have got jobs and money. Even if the money doesn’t come to me, the young people got it,” he said.
Eimily Fwachan agrees.
""I benefitted. I didn’t ride a motorcycle before. My motorcycle is there with my son, he is riding it. These days we are lacking water, he is fetching water at the water centre using the motorcycle I got through this compensation money from Total.""
But others are resisting the lure of compensation.
""Some people who signed, said ‘They say they are going to take us to court.’ So those people think that if they take them to court they will lose their money. So, they decided to sign. But we refused. Till now we have refused,"" said John Tundulu.
Others said they are not happy with the way the land acquisition was settled and have yet to see any money from TotalEnergies.
Drilling looks set to go ahead after a French court on Tuesday dismissed a case brought by NGOs against the company.

                        Nigeria
Regional rivals Morocco and Algeria are engaged in two competing gas pipeline megaprojects linking them to Nigeria, targeting the European market, but in a context where the EU would like to do without gas by the end of the decade.
The most recent is the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline (NMGP), approximately 6,000 km long, which should cross 13 African countries on the Atlantic seaboard to transport billions of cubic meters of Nigerian gas to the Cherifian kingdom. From there, it must be connected to the Maghreb Europe Gas Pipeline (GME).
No start date for construction has been set: ""The pipeline is being planned. We are at the feasibility study stage,"" Nigerian Oil Minister Timipre Sylva told AFP.
The idea for the project was launched in 2016 by King Mohammed VI during a visit to Abuja, aimed at strengthening partnerships with African countries.
Its revival is explained by the decision of Algiers - Africa's leading exporter of natural gas - to terminate last year the GME contract supplying Spain with Algerian gas via Morocco, after the rupture of diplomatic relations with Rabat.
These dissensions were motivated in particular by the thorny file of Western Sahara - territory on which Rabat claims its sovereignty while Algiers supports the separatists of the Polisario Front - deprived Morocco of the Algerian gas which it took as a right of passage.
Beyond that, the NMGP is part of a geopolitical context marked by soaring hydrocarbon prices since the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
The implementation of this giant gas pipeline - at an estimated cost of 23 billion euros - remains however conditional on ""obtaining the agreement of the countries through which it will pass"", recalled the Nigerian Minister of Oil.
At the end of 2022, Rabat and Abuja signed seven memorandums of understanding with Gambia, Guinea -Bissau, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Mauritania, and Senegal, and another with the Economic Community of Eastern European States. West Africa (ECOWAS).
Agreements that ""confirm the commitment of the parties in this strategic project"", welcomed the Moroccan Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM).
Rabat is banking on Nigeria's enormous reserves to create ""a stable, predictable and mutually profitable gas market"" in Africa, Moroccan geopolitics researcher Jamal Machrouh told AFP, also stressing its ""strategic interest for Europe"".
But questions are emerging when Brussels says it wants to get rid of fossil fuels in the medium term.
""We have to count when it (the gas pipeline) is finished. Are we still going to want to use gas, methane?"", wondered recently in Rabat the head of European diplomacy, Josep Borrell, stressing that Morocco has a strong potential in clean energies such as hydrogen, wind, and solar.
The acceleration of cooperation between Rabat and Abuja coincides with the relaunch of the Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline (TSGP) to link Nigeria to Algeria via Niger, at a cost estimated at between 12 and 18 billion euros. Last July, Algiers, Abuja, and Niamey signed a memorandum of understanding to materialize this 4,128 km long gas pipeline, without setting a start-up date.
Launched in 2009, the project also aims to transport Nigerian gas to the European continent. Once it has arrived in Algeria, it should be shipped there, in particular via the Transmed gas pipeline which already links the Algerian deposits to Italy via Tunisia.
""Technical studies are in progress,"" Algerian Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab said on February 18 in Algiers. According to the Algerian expert Ahmed Tartar, the three partners are now ""looking for donors"".
""We can estimate a delay of 2 to 3 years for the finalization of the project"" which ""will meet a significant part of the future needs of Europe"", assures AFP Mr. Tartar, whose country is the third supplier of natural gas for Europe.
Optimism tempered by analyst Geoff Porter who underlines ""its great vulnerability to jihadist attacks"" in the Sahelian zone and to the hostility ""of local communities if they have the feeling of being exploited for a project from which they derive no benefit "".
Another downside: Europe, which is seeking to free itself from Russian gas, could not accept ""a strong dependence on a single supplier"", whether Algerian or Moroccan, according to Moroccan researcher Machrouh.

                        France
A French court on Tuesday dismissed a landmark case against TotalEnergies for a massive oil project in Uganda and Tanzania after several NGOs filed a suit to suspend the controversial project.  
It was the first case of its kind in France, and activists had hoped it would set a legal precedent to halt projects deemed harmful to the environment and human rights.
Six NGOs that filed the suit argued the development of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) failed to adhere to a ""duty of vigilance"", a 2017 law that compels companies to avoid grave harm to human rights, health, safety and the environment.
The court on Tuesday ruled the case was ""inadmissible"", saying the plaintiffs did not correctly follow court procedures against the French energy giant.
It said the plaintiffs submitted accounts to the court in December that were ""substantially different"" from those that were presented to TotalEnergies in a formal notice in 20 19 when the case was initiated.
The suit was brought by two French and four Ugandan NGOs, which accused TotalEnergies of taking land from more than 100,000 people without adequate compensation.
They also said the company drilled wells in the biodiversity-rich Murchison Falls National Park on the shores of Lake Albert.
Friends of the Earth and Survival, the two French NGOs, and the Ugandan groups denied having substantially modified their submissions to the court.
They ""only clarified them and consolidated their arguments with more than 200 documents of supporting evidence"", said Juliette Renaud, a campaigner with Friends of the Earth.
The plaintiffs, which can appeal the decision, said they would speak to ""the affected communities"" about next steps, Renaud added.
- Economic boon -
The $10 billion oilfields and pipeline project has been hailed as an economic boon for Uganda and Tanzania, where many live in poverty, while being strongly opposed by environmentalists.
The project is being jointly developed by TotalEnergies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC), along with the state-owned Uganda National Oil Company.
The 1,443-kilometre (900-mile) pipeline will transport crude from vast oilfields being developed in Lake Albert in northwestern Uganda to a Tanzanian port on the Indian Ocean.
Lake Albert, a natural border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo, lies atop an estimated 6.5 billion barrels of crude, of which about 1.4 billion barrels are currently considered recoverable.
Tanzanian Energy Minister January Makamba this month rejected the environmental and rights concerns as ""propaganda"", saying the country complied with environmental, safety and human rights standards.
Tuesday's ruling in France is the first instance of the ""duty of vigilance"" being tested in a courtroom.
Several legal proceedings for failure to comply with the ""duty of vigilance"" are underway against other French companies, including Casino, Suez, Yves Rocher and BNP Paribas.

BY JERRY SEFEA Member of Parliament is leading his district in saying no to power blackouts as they work on their energy projects.“We say no to power blackouts in our district,” Member for Bulolo Sam Basil Jr said.
He said AG Investment Limited has done a tremendous job in upgrading Baiyune hydropower station and now working on Bapa underground hydro project that will solve the power blackout issues in Bulolo.PPL chief executive officer (CEO), Obed Batia, however, said establishment of any power sources must be verified by PNG Power and must come through them for authorisation.This is because PPL has a policy and Act in place that serves the right to review any power sources and requests businesses or organisations to seek their authorisation following the correct process.
Meanwhile, Mr Basil Jr confidently said the hydropower is the new definition of “No-Blackouts” and called on PNG Power to review its policy and Act to allow power generation sources to partner with them.PPL has been branded as not capable to provide efficient supply of power without any disruption and must not continue in that way to hold businesses and services at ransom.With power outage issues currently experienced in the country, Bulolo is now taking a big step forward to eradicate the word “blackout” as it is a thing of the past with the installing of Biyune and Bapa hydro schemes.
“We will light up Bulolo, Lae industrial zones and Wafi-Golpu Project,” Mr Basil said.Mr Batia also said the current power issues in the country are something beyond their control, however, they are now undertaking trials and studies to ensure advancement of their operations.Mr Basil said Bapa is a million kina underground (tunnelling system) hydropower project for Bulolo district implemented by his father late Deputy Prime Minister and Bulolo MP Sam Basil, following the district’s rural electrification program.He said AG Investment is well known for its electricity development services in the country.AG has built 50 megawatts for Edevu, 10 megawatts for Baiyune, 3 megawatts for Popondetta, 85kva for Garaina and now 9-12 megawatts for Bapa using its technologies.“There is no doubt that Lae and Bulolo will soon see no more blackouts,” Mr Basil said.

			Good energy strategy lacking in PNG

Energy is needed daily. It is vital. Any general science, physics or engineering student knows this, and their teacher or professor emphasises this fact time and again in their lessons.In today’s world, the availability of reliable electrical energy means you have electricity to power your lights in the house and every other appliance or gadget that runs on electricity or battery power.That includes your computers and your mobile devices, which have batteries that need charging regularly.
In Papua New Guinea in recent weeks, all sorts of power issues again underscored this fact, where power outages occurred all around the country and there was the issue with aviation fuel which in turn disrupted flights in many centres.It is pleasing to hear of firms and authorities as well as state-owned enterprises (SOEs) working together to ensure our towns and cities and local communities are accessing power 24/7.That also includes the availability of fuel power our vehicles, not to mention the aircraft and helicopters which also need a different kind of fuel to enable them to serve their clients.
It is good to see that Puma Energy and PNG Power have come to a mutual understanding that will ensure power supply is restored in most of the centres which rely on diesel fuel to generate power, as reported in one of our stories yesterday.Recently, as per our business story today, Kumul Petroleum Holdings Ltd (KPHL) announced its plans to supply liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the coast of Huon Gulf district to power the upcoming Wafi-Golpu mine project in Bulolo district, Morobe Province.The business models KPHL is proposing have advanced strategies, including the use of a floating storage regasification and power unit, which is a ship that will be permanently parked outside of Labu and will be sending gas to the mine project.
Morobe Governor Luther Wenge is in support of this plan and hopes to have some of the power generated in that facility supplying Lae and removing the “Blackout City” tag from the industrial hub.The need for energy cannot be emphasised enough.Now, here is the thing that those in authority, the government as well as those who are in charge of the energy management bodies and ministries, including the Department of Petroleum and Department of State Enterprises, must understand: PNG will never be short of energy.We have an abundance of energy sources that have not been fully developed to generate power for us.There is solar energy, running water for hydro schemes, wind energy and thermal energy, particularly on islands or coastal areas. And, all these are non renewable energy forms, unlike diesel fuel and LNG.These renewable energy forms must be properly developed to ensure that PNG continues to have power to assist in the development process when fossil fuels run out.This is also part of the much talked-about Climate Change aims and goals, where the use of safer energy resources is encouraged to reverse or minimise the adverse effects that the use of fossil fuels have brought about.The challenge for us in PNG is to draw up a proper holistic energy plan to ensure that we properly develop our renewable energy resources to prevent the continuous blackouts that are experienced around the country.The two departments named and relevant authorities must work on the plan.We in PNG are not short of energy. We lack a good holistic strategy to properly harness the energy resources that we have. That is the way forward.

                        Rwanda
Here in Kirehe a local electrician has harnessed hydroelectric power to create a new future for his neighbours.
These dams circumvent rivers into waterways that feed a dam which is fed through a pipeline to a small plant that creates power.
It’s two and a half kilometres from the water basin to the Nyagakoma hydropower plant set up by Israel Habimana.
The Rwandan government hopes that allowing small independent power producers to set up homes without power will get electricity without being on the country’s main grid.
Habimana's hydroelectric plant employs about 15 people.
He says it has yet to reap the rewards of investment in the company, but it’s already changing people’s lives.
Habimana got the idea for hydroelectricity after seeing a similar set-up elsewhere near the capital Kigali.
He says: ”It is not long since people here have known electricity, many died without having seen it. The idea of building this infrastructure came to me when I saw a lot of lamps in Kibungo and then a small power station that I had seen at the religious house.”
”I never went to school, but that didn't stop me from doing what I wanted to do, even if it was very difficult for me. I often visited the mini hydroelectric plant of religious people without telling them my objective, and I observed how the machines worked and I did the same thing,” says Habimana.
Although he’s received investment from the government owned Rwanda Energy Group (REG), Habimana says there have been some obstacles.
“The challenges I have are mostly related to the availability of materials, especially cables. Often REG (Rwanda Energy Group) gives me these materials but not all the time. Also, it is difficult for me to increase the capacity of my infrastructure because the demand is high and my revenues are not significant,” he explains.
According to statistics provided by the Rwanda Energy Group (REG), the number of households with access to electricity in the country has increased from 10% in 2010 to 75% in 2022.
The total number of connected households across the country is now over two million, but at least 1.4 million families don’t yet have access.
Jacqueline Nyirahirwa's family is among those who are getting power from the Habimana’s hydroelectric plant.
They’ve been without electricity for about 15 years.
Nyirahirwa, a teacher says that life without electricity in her family has been difficult.
”As we live far from public facilities, it’s difficult to live here and we were trapped. Even the basic activities that allow a person to lead a moderate life are not possible without electricity, so life was impossible here,” she says.
According to Nyirahirwa the family is looking forward to a new future.
""With the arrival of electricity in my family a lot will change. We will start watching television, my children will study in the evening without any problem and even safety is there when there is lighting in a house,” she says.
Until now the children here have had to ensure their homework was completed during daylight.
The Rwanda Energy Group is a government owned holding set up to import, export, generate and distribute electricity in the country.
It’s CEO Ron Weiss says at the time Habimana was the only person offering the hope of electricity to the neighbourhood.
“We supported him (Israel Habimana), we even helped him in different ways, even we encourage him to continue because this specific area of Kirehe in that time we need electricity and the grid is not yet coming nearby,” he says.
Since the arrival of electricity in the area, new businesses have sprung up, but in Nyawera, at least 120 families are still waiting for electricity because the plant is too small to generate enough power for everyone who needs it.

Italy's Eni signs $8 billion gas deal as Meloni visits Libya
                                                      Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and Libya's Tripoli-based Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah hold a joint press conference in the Libyan capital, on January 28, 2023. 
                                                                                    -

                        Libya
Italian energy giant Eni signed an $8 billion gas deal with Libya's state-run National Oil Corporation Saturday as Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni visited Tripoli.
European governments have been scrambling to find alternatives to Russian gas since last year's invasion of Ukraine saw deliveries slashed to less than half their pre-war levels, sending prices soaring to record highs and triggering costly state subsidies to protect consumers.
Eni said it was the first major project in Libya since early 2000 and involved the development of two offshore gas fields.
""The combined gas production from the two structures will start in 2026 and reach a plateau of 750 million of standard gas cubic feet per day,"" Eni said in a statement.
""Production will be ensured through two main platforms tied in to the existing treatment facilities at the Mellitah Complex,"" 80 kilometres (50 miles) west of the capital, it added.
""The project also includes the construction of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) facility at Mellitah, allowing a significant reduction of the overall carbon footprint,"" the company added.
""The overall estimated investment will amount to $8 billion, with significant impact on the industry and the associated supply chain, allowing a significant contribution to the Libyan economy.""
Eni has an 80 percent share of Libya's gas production.
The agreement was signed in the presence of Meloni and her host Abdulhamid Dbeibah, who heads the UN-brokered Government of National Unity which is contested by a rival administration in the east.
Her visit is the first by a European leader to war-battered Libya since her predecessor Mario Draghi's visit in April 2021.
Meloni also visited Algeria this week seeking supply deals from Africa's top gas exporter.
During her trip to Libya, she was expected to discuss the issue of migration amid rising numbers of irregular migrants from Libya to Italy.
Libya is a conduit for thousands of people each year fleeing conflict and poverty across Africa, seeking refuge across the Mediterranean in Europe.
Meloni's far-right government took office in October, vowing to stop migrant landings in Italy, which reached more than 105,000 in 2022.

The Papua LNG Project is a direct response to the growing need for energy in the Asia Market, a strong contribution to the economic growth of Papua New Guinea, a focus on people development and a landmark project in terms of sustainability, carbon footprint optimisation and biodiversity consideration.This is according to Total Energies in a statement yesterday.Total Energies senior vice president EP Asia Pacific, Julien Pouget said this project has an estimated production rate of 5.6 million tonnes per year (mtpa) of liquefied natural gas.
Mr Pouget said the upstream front-end engineering and design (FEED) was taken in July 2022, the downstream FEED will be announced within a couple of months. Planning has not changed with a final investment decision (FID) to be taken around end 2023 and first gas by end of 2027.“The project will ensure that a skilled local workforce is established.The Papua LNG project expects to offer over 3000 positions to nationals over the lifespan of the project.
Associated training assessments are underway to ensure this,” he said.“Despite the FID decision not taken yet, scholarships have already been awarded to 120 students from the Gulf Province to attend carpentry, construction, and maintenance fitting and machinery courses.An additional 20 students are part of a program to be qualified as seamen for the shipping sector and able to perform maritime jobs beyond the construction phase of the project.”
Mr Pouget said it is essential to put emphasis on sustainability as one of the main pillars of the Papua LNG Project.“This is already illustrated through the innovative solution to reinject native CO2 from the producing wells from day one and reducing the carbon footprint of the project is a day-to-day objective.In terms of biodiversity, the Papua LNG Project wants to enhance the area and commits to be positive biodiversity net gain,” he said.“To date, 140 hectares of forest out of the target of 1000 hectares have been planted in Kuriva, as part of restoration efforts. This activity has already created 60 employment opportunities out of the projected 100 in 2023.“An independent advisory panel with important experts from various sectors (tropical forest, anthropology, and community development) has been set up to develop recommendations for better contributions to the communities and to achieve the positive biodiversity net gain.”

                        Mozambique
In Mozambique’s Nampula province, UNHCR has partnered with the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the government to provide electricity to refugees and displaced people living at the Maratane refugee settlement.
under the Energy for All project.
Charlotte Fatuma and Neema Cenga are refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) living in Mozambique. 
Charlotte is a successful businesswoman, running a small shop in Maratane refugee settlement, and Neema is a mother trying to raise and educate her children.
“When you don’t put on electricity, everything is dark. The customers can’t enter here to buy when you don’t have electricity"", said Charlotte Fatuma, Congolese Refugee living in Mozambique. 
""I am happy about the electricity because I don’t need to buy kerosene anymore.It helps me a lot. My children are happy because the young ones used to be afraid of the night, because it was dark"", added Neema Cenga, a Mozambican Internally Displaced Person. 
The Energy for All project has several components and contributes to the government’s ambition to provide every Mozambican, including refugees and displaced people in Nampula province with electricity by 2030.
""Nampula province's exposure to extreme events makes it one of the most vulnerable provinces, because it has a long coastline, which is cyclically affected by natural extreme events. UNHCR is doing its best in benefiting the communities mainly in the approach of integrating the internally displaced. The province has defined as a priority, when we benefit the internally displaced, we also look at the host communities. These kinds of actions are taking place with more impact"", explained Alberto Armando, from Mozambique's National Disasters Management Institute.
In December 2022 Mozambique counted over one million internally displaced people due to violence in Cabo Delgado province and as a result of climate change. 
The country also hosts around 29,000 refugees.

Uganda's veteran President Yoweri Museveni accused Europe on Wednesday of ""brazen double standards"" towards Africa in its climate and energy policies.
He lashed out at Europe's return to coal-fired power plants in the face of the energy crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine while at the same time telling African nations not to use fossil fuels.
""We will not accept one rule for them and another rule for us,"" Museveni wrote in a blog published Wednesday that coincides with the UN's COP27 climate summit taking place in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
""Europe's failure to meet its climate goals should not be Africa's problem,"" he added.
Museveni's comments follow warnings from African leaders at COP27 about the damage climate change is already wreaking on the continent.
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in February warned that tens of millions of Africans face a future marked by drought, disease and displacement due to global heating.
Wealthy nations have failed to provide a pledged $100 billion a year from 2020 to developing nations to help them build resilience and green their economies, reaching just $83 billion according to the UN.
Africa's carbon footprint is the lowest of any continent, accounting for around three percent of global CO2 emissions.
""We will not allow African progress to be the victim of Europe's failure to meet its own climate goals,"" said Museveni, one of Africa's longest serving leaders.
""It is morally bankrupt for Europeans to expect to take Africa's fossil fuels for their own energy production but refuse to countenance African use of those same fuels for theirs.""
Museveni said European nations needed to end their ""brazen double-standards"" and ""hypocrisy"", and took aim at what he said were conditions that Western investment in fossil fuels in Africa was possible only for oil and gas that would be sent to Europe.
Earlier this year, France's TotalEnergies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation signed a $10-billion agreement to develop Ugandan oilfields and ship the crude through a 1,445-kilometre (900-mile) pipeline to a Tanzanian port on the Indian Ocean.
The project, which includes drilling in Murchison Falls, Uganda's largest national park, has run into strong opposition from activists and environmental groups that say it threatens the region's fragile ecosystem and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people.
The European Parliament in September adopted a resolution calling for the project to be delayed over ""rights violations"", infuriating Kampala.

Environmental activists, religious figures, and believers protested Tuesday in Paris against the mega oil projects of the French group TotalEnergies in Uganda and Tanzania, a first action led by the movements Extinction Rebellion Spiritualities and GreenFaith.
""Deliver us from Total"", ""Warm hearts, not pipelines"": they were about thirty gathered in front of a TotalEnergies gas station in the south of Paris, according to a journalist of the AFP.
Extinction Rebellion Spiritualities is a branch of the Extinction Rebellion movement, well known for its civil disobedience actions. GreenFaith is an inter-religious NGO born in the United States which fights ""for climate justice"", supported by religious volunteers.
The protesters were opposing the East African Crude Oil Pipeline (EACOP) and Tilenga oil field project in Uganda and Tanzania, initiated by TotalEnergies. The NGOs accuse the multinationals of taking over land through expropriation and are concerned about the environmental impact of these projects.
""Our traditions and our religions urge us not to remain silent,"" said Rabbi Yeshaya Dalsace, one of the religious figures present, along with Pastor Caroline Ingrand-Hoffet, President of the Rassemblement des musulmans de France Anouar Kbibech, Buddhist Master Olivier Reigen Wang-Genh and Bishop Marc Stenger.
These religious figures arrived carrying an empty coffin with African landscapes painted on it.
""I'm Catholic and I think it's great to see religious figures taking a stand on the divisive issue of ecology,"" said Isabelle, 43, who like all the members of Extinction Rebellion refuses to give her last name.
TotalEnergies has been sued by several environmental NGOs over its activities in Uganda and Tanzania. The company will appear before the Paris Court of Justice on December 7 to discuss the matter.
The associations are targeting two colossal projects that are intrinsically linked: the Tilenga project, a 419-well drilling project in Uganda, one third of which is in the Murchison Falls natural park; and the EACOP (East African Crude Oil Pipeline) project, the world's longest heated oil pipeline, which crosses Tanzania over nearly 1,500 km, crossing several protected natural areas.
TotalEnergies reacted in a press release, stressing that ""all the partners in the Tilenga and EACOP projects are committed to implementing them in a way that places environmental and biodiversity issues and the rights of the communities concerned at the heart of the project, in accordance with the highest international standards.
These projects, the press release adds, ""represent a major development challenge for Uganda and Tanzania and we are doing everything possible to make them exemplary in terms of transparency, shared prosperity, economic and social progress, sustainable development, environmental awareness, and respect for human rights.

PNG has huge potential in the geothermal energy space and its development must be given due consideration.This is to ensure the country achieves the National Energy Policy of providing 70 per cent of electricity to households by 2030.National Energy Authority managing director, Ronald Meketa made this known as one of the department’s priority agenda.
He said the work towards developing these geothermal sites is feasible and not a pipe dream.Preliminary discussions have already begun with industry players and whatever outcome reached, he said, will be tabled for the NEC deliberation.He said the lack of electricity has had an adverse effect on PNG’s socioeconomic landscape and negatively impinged on the livelihood of the people.
NEA is now pushing for more electricity generation and transmission lines, working with PPL and other independent power producers to provide greater electricity coverage.Mr Meketa said Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) and GoPNG had already signed a master plan to develop the Bialla geothermal energy site but there is more than one site in WNB and due to high demand for electricity, its vital other potential geothermal sites in the province are given due consideration.“These hot springs at WNB represent some of the most active geothermal sites in the Pacific Ring of Fire,” he said.
As an illustration, of the top 10 geothermal power projects in the world, Indonesia has three and Philippines ranks second place with the US, each with two.These three geothermal power projects in Indonesia have a total installed capacity of nearly 1GW (or 1000MW) more than enough to provide accessible, reliable and affordable electricity for not only both WNB and ENB but all households in PNG,” Mr Maketa said.He said NEA now places geothermal power projects as its top renewable energy priority consistent with the low carbon emissions commitments.

                        Egypt
Activists attending the COP27 climate conference in Egypt held a demonstration on Tuesday, calling on countries to stop funding new gas projects in Africa.
Faced with an energy crisis because of Russia’s war in Ukraine, western nations have been looking elsewhere to shore up their supply.
‘If your country is breaking a promise not to finance new fossil fuel development overseas, by investing in new gas infrastructure in Africa, then you are not a climate leader,’ Ugandan climate activist, Vanessa Nakate, told delegates at an event on clean energy transition hosted by Britain on the sidelines of the summit.
‘If your country’s planned expansion of its oil and gas development would by itself put the 1.5 degrees Celsius target out of reach, then you are not a climate leader. So, I ask each of the leaders here today. Will you be on the right side of history?’ she said.
Countries agreed in the 2015 Paris climate accord to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century if possible.
‘Don't gas Africa’Nakate was one of many African climate activists taking aim at world leaders who continue to back new fossil fuel projects despite warnings from scientists.
‘The Russia-Ukraine crisis has caused increased demand for gas in Africa. There is a new project now, the Nigeria-Morocco Gas Pipeline Project, taking gas from Nigeria through Morocco to Europe. And we are saying we don't want that to happen,’ said Nigerian climate activist, Innocent Ighodalo Edemhanria.
Nakate warned that the annual meeting is being infiltrated by oil and gas representatives who are turning it into ‘a sales and marketing conference for more pollution and more destruction and more devastation’.
Environmental groups say they have counted more than 600 delegates with links to the fossil fuel industry at the conference.
‘Countries of the global north have been shopping for gas in Africa, using the energy crisis at the moment, the war in Ukraine and the energy poverty in Africa as a pretext to start doing gas production in Africa,’ said Ina Maria Shikongo, a Namibian climate activist. 
‘What that means is obviously opening up new gas fields, oil fields, and also putting the entire carbon budget at risk.’
Scientists are warnings that new fossil fuel projects will push global temperatures to dangerous highs. And they say that with about 1.2 Celsius of warming already reached, the 1.5 degree target is already likely to be missed.

                        Mozambique
Mozambique has officially started exporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) produced in the country's north which is plagued by jihadist attacks.
President Filipe Nyusi made the announcement Sunday (Nov 13). It is the first shipment of gas under a long-term purchase and sale contract with British giant BP. The off-shore plant located in the Cabo delgado Province is managed by the Italian energy company Eni.
""It is with great honor that I announce the start of the first export of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), produced in the Rovuma, in Mozambique, by the Coral Sul FLNG Project. The British Sponsor ship departs Mozambican waters for the international market. ""
Mozambique has set high hopes on vast natural gas deposits -- the largest ever found in Sub-Sahara Africa -- that was discovered in the northern Cabo Delgado province in 2010.
""The completion of this international venture is a sign of the recognition by the market that Mozambique offers a stable, transparent and predictable environment for the realization of multi-billion investments, where high technology stands out in order to monetize resources in a phase of the energy transition, therefore it must bring pride to all Mozambicans. ""
Once tapped, Mozambique could become one of the world's 10 biggest exporters.
According to the BP 2021 Statistical Review of World Energy, Africa is home to over 620 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves. Through the production of LNG for domestic use and export, leaders hope to support industrialization schemes.

Electric bus debuts in Nairobi in clean energy push

                                                                                    -

                        Kenya
A Nairobi-based green transport company unveiled Wednesday an electric bus.
Nairobi is referred to as the 'Green City in the Sun' because of the lush parks surrounding the east African capital. Roam, a Kenyan-Swedish company now wants that epithet to also refer to the city’s environmentally friendly mobility.
It unveiled Wednesday an electric bus in a city where polluting exhaust fumes contribute to a thick smog.
""It’s the first electric mass transit bus in Kenya that we designed since last year and co-manufactured it with a global partner"", Dennis Wakaba exclaimed.
""This represents a shift towards better public transport, where we can have people ride in comfort and enjoy the ride with a clear conscience because we’re talking about zero emissions"", the Roam project coordinator said.
The brightly painted bus pulled out into the notorious morning traffic in the city of nearly five million, which lacks a state-run transport network.
Most commuter transport is privately operated in Nairobi and Roam said fares on the electric bus would rival those offered by its smoggier competitors.
Innovation hubIf only one charging station exists in the metropolis of nearly five million, the team Roam was not deterred. They wanted to encourage green commuting in a city where smog-belching minivans are a far more familiar sight.
The 77-seat bus has a top speed of 70 kilometres per hour and a battery pack allows it to travel 360 kilometres before requiring a 2-hour recharge.
It was also designed to be accessible and inclusive for all.
""It can accommodate people in wheelchairs, the elderly… So we have priority seats inside this bus"", Wakaba reveals.
""Nairobi has been seen as a leader of innovation, and we see Nairobi as a good starting point and as an innovation hub to deploy these buses"", he adds.
Roam -- which also manufactures electric safari vehicles and motorbikes -- says it plans to roll out 100 electric buses over the next year.
They have also started the design process for a smaller bus to complement the 77-seater.
Green revolutionEighty percent of Nairobi's commuters use matatus -- minivans that are poorly regulated and maintained, and known for frightening manoeuvres and trails of black smoke streaking behind battered chassis.
It is estimated that less than 500 of Kenya's 3.5 million cars are electric, despite the government making them cheaper than ever to purchase.
The transport sector accounts for 12 percent of Kenya's emissions footprint -- though that figure rises to 45 percent in Nairobi, according to government figures.
Earlier this year another electric mobility startup, BasiGo, unveiled a 25-seater bus with a 250-kilometre range for Nairobi's roads.
Kenya sources most of its energy from renewable resources and is seeking to cut CO2 emissions by 32 percent by 2030.

The US government, through the US Agency for International Development launched an Energy Sector Investor Guide for Papua New Guinea in collaboration with Investment Promotion Authority last week.This Energy Sector Investor Guide is a result of collaboration between the USAID-Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership (PEP) Activity and IPA and aims to help catalyse private investments in PNG’s energy sector.The guide provides an overview of the country’s economy, political environment, regulatory framework, investment climate and energy sector dynamics and also provides step-by-step guidance for interested investors for the development and implementation of energy projects
. It includes a checklist of requirements from relevant government agencies and information of energy projects.“This is the first energy specific sector guide for PNG, and USAID-PEP is pleased to be in partnership with IPA in this collaboration,” USAID-PEP senior PPP and project finance advisor, Julinette Bayking said.“It serves as an information tool for investors to follow for development and implementation of energy projects.”
Also present at the launching was USAID energy policy specialist from the Philippines Mission, Leonila Gutierrez and IPA’s managing director, Clarence Hoot.“USAID looks forward to working in collaboration with IPA in strengthening partnerships as a strategy to assist the Government of PNG to improve electrification in PNG, and that is demonstrated in the collaboration for the Energy Sector Investor Guide,” she said.IPA managing director Clarence Hoot expressed similar sentiments and looks forward to further collaboration with USAID-PEP as per the MOU agreement.
“The Energy Investor Guide includes a checklist of requirements from relevant government agencies and information on various permits, licensees and investment opportunities. It serves as an information tool for potential domestic and international investors, ” he said.The USAID-PEP activity is a five-year project in partnership with the PNG govt that will contribute to the goal of connecting 70 per cent of PNG’s population to electricity by 2030.

                        Kenya
Kenya intends to pursue the construction of a gas pipeline linking Tanzania's main city, Dar es Salaam, to the coastal city of Mombasa and on to the capital Nairobi, in a bid to reduce energy costs, Kenya's president William Ruto has said.
The 600km pipeline has been estimated by local reports to cost around $1.1bn (£990m).
The President spoke to Tanzanian media on Monday, shortly after holding bilateral talks with President Samia Suluhu on his first visit to the neighbouring country since taking office in September.
The project would reduce energy charges in the industrial sector, as well as for families in their homes, Mr Ruto said.
In May last year, Mr Ruto's predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta and Ms Suluhu signed a preliminary agreement to transport gas from Tanzania to Kenya for power generation and possibly for cooking and heating.
The agreement was part of a longer-term plan to develop infrastructure between the two major East African economies.

BY LORRAINE WOHIThe Pasca A offshore gas project in the Gulf of Papua will focus to help transform the PNG energy sector and to boost sustainable growth in the country.Twinza Oil (PNG) Limited chairman, Stephen Quantrill said when in full production, the Pasca A Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) project’s landed prices will be lower than the current LPG imports.
He said Pasca A has made a commitment of 10 per cent domestic market obligation (DMO) as a benefit to PNG once the project begins.Mr Quantrill said the commitment is aligned with PNG Sustainable Development aspirations with the vision of meeting full carbon neutrality by 2050 and electrification target by reaching 70 per cent PNG population accessing electricity by 2030.He said an affordable LPG can transform the PNG energy sector and help for sustainable growth.
“The advantage of the LPG includes a low carbon substitute for burning fuel, oil and diesel, and it is profitable and affordable by land and marine transport system,” Mr Quantrill said.“It requires a low infrastructure investment to reach in diesel and is very accessible.”Mr Quantrill views the Pasca A LPG component as a very important product to deliver energy to PNG.
He said the project timeline is in line with PNG’s target of meeting the 2 per cent of the global LNG supply.In 2021 the Pasca A project terms were agreed upon by PNG government and further investment and project financing are pending for the gas agreement and petroleum development licence (PDL).Once started, Pasca A project will contribute K8.6 billion revenue to PNG over the lifetime of the project with K500 million on an annual basis.The project will further provide 300 construction and 500 permanent jobs in PNG, K18 billion in GDP over the lifetime of the project and K400 million spent in PNG as the annual operating cost in the country.

BY LORRAINE WOHIThe Papua Liquefied Natural Gas project (Papua LNG) is projected to deliver a further 2-3 million tonnes per annum of Liquefied Natural Gas by 2032.Minister for Petroleum and Energy, Kerenga Kua views PNG to be an exporter of LNG in the coming decades with Total Energies announcing FEED (front-end engineering and design) for the Papua LNG Project in July this year.
Mr Kua told the 2022 National Petroleum and Energy summit in Port Moresby yesterday that the project will almost double PNG’s exports of LNG from the current 8.5 million tonnes per annum to 14-15 million tonnes per annum.“Papua LNG is likely to reach its final investment decision (FID) in late 2023 and with a four year construction phase, we expect the first phase of LNG around the end of 2027 and late 2028,” Minister Kua said.“This will be followed by FID and construction on P’nyang gas project with further plans to deliver 2-3 million tonnes per annum of LNG by 2032.”
Mr Kua said internationally, LNG is the transitional fuel as countries develop their renewable energy resources and PNG is on the pathway to achieve that milestone.He said PNG as an exporter of LNG will assist in the future when they could be customer for PNG green energy export.ExxonMobil PNG managing director, Peter Larden said PNG is well placed to expand its LNG capacity clearly built from the solid foundation of PNG LNG project.
Mr Larden said the country has the opportunity now to see new developments progress which could advance the nation’s economy for many decades to come.“PNG exports somewhere between 8 and 9 million tonnes of LNG per year and even if the Papua Project comes online, it will still represent about 2 per cent of global demand or global supply through the 2030 period,” Mr Larden said.He said the good news is PNG has number of advantages as the country can be the supply source of LNG to meet the global demand, especially in the Asia Pacific region.TotalEnergies PNG Ltd managing director Jean-Marc Noiray said Total is focusing on its early works on the Papua LNG project once sanctioned.He said the Papua LNG’s national content principles and practices are under development to continue driving these outcomes into and through the large project undertaking.“The national content plan will provide the guiding framework and also the collection of reporting from across the project for our reporting to government,” Mr Noiray said.

BY MAXINE KAMUSDirio Gas and Power’s next project will be to supply 66 megawatts gas fired power station gas for the Ramu Grid.Mineral Resource Development Company (MRDC) chief operating officer John Tuaim speaking at the PNG Energy Summit in Port Moresby said currently Dirio is supplying 45 megawatts (MW) gas fired power station for the Port Moresby grid and work for the next project is expected to commence in early 2023 for the Ramu Grid.
Mr Tuaim said Dirio’s first project outside Port Moresby is already supplying the city and they are looking at the next project which will be up at Hela Province (66 MW to be supplied) that will be connected to the Ramu Grid and will also supply Southern Highlands Province.“Dirio will be using the same technology and same landowner groups for the first project in the next project up in Hela and we have already signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with PNG Power Limited,” he said.“We will also utilise the same strategic staff and local companies to do the next project as well. Once it is done it will provide a cheaper cost of generation power for PNG Power as well.”
He said that after the project up in Hela, Dirio is looking forward to a long term solution for PNG to provide 283MW gas fired generation to 12 locations around the country which will bring the benefit of PNG’s gas reserves countrywide.Mr Tuaim said work for that is expected to commence in 2023 as National Executive Council (NEC) has already approved it and they are pending the PPA with PNG Power Limited at 50 per cent of current cost.

Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline project takes off
                                                      A gas pipeline at the Afam VI power plant in Port Harcourt, 29 September 2015

                        Morocco
A memorandum of understanding on a gas pipeline project linking Nigeria to Morocco, which will also supply West Africa and Europe, was signed on Thursday in Rabat, an official source said.
The memorandum on the Nigeria-Morocco gas pipeline project (NMGP) was initialled by the leaders of the National Nigerian Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC), the Moroccan Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines (ONHYM) and a senior official of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in charge of energy, according to a joint statement.
The text signed ""confirms the commitment of ECOWAS and all the countries involved to contribute to the feasibility of this important project"", the statement said.
The project, for which no timetable has been set, is being carried out in a geopolitical context marked by strong international demand for gas and oil and a surge in prices following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Several countries, particularly in Europe, are seeking to reduce their dependence on Russian supplies.
The 6,000 km Nigeria-Morocco project will cross 13 African countries along the Atlantic coast and supply the landlocked states of Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali, according to the statement.
It is expected to bring more than 5,000 billion cubic metres of natural gas to Morocco.
From there, it will be connected directly to the Maghreb Europe Gas Pipeline (GME) and the European gas network.
The signing of the NMGP memorandum announced at the end of 2016, comes against the backdrop of heightened regional rivalry between Morocco and Algeria, Africa's largest exporter of natural gas and the world's 7th largest.
The crisis between the two Maghreb heavyweights culminated in the rupture of their diplomatic relations in August 2021 at the initiative of Algiers.
Following this rupture, Algeria deprived Rabat of its gas by closing in October the Maghreb-Europe gas pipeline (GME) carrying Algerian gas to Spain and transiting through Morocco.
Since then, Rabat has been seeking to diversify its gas supply.
At the end of July, the Algerian, Nigerian and Nigerian energy ministers signed a memorandum of understanding to materialise a competing mega-project for a trans-Saharan gas pipeline (TSGP), more than 4,000 km long, in order to transport Nigerian gas to Europe via Niger and Algeria.
No date has been given for the completion of the Trans-Saharan.

PRIME Minister James Marape is keen on delivering the country’s first Green Energy Project by end of 2023.The clean green energy projects initiative moves one step closer to takeoff following Mr Marape’s second meeting with Fortescue Future Industries (FFI) South-East Asia President Allard M Nooy in Port Moresby yesterday.Mr Marape, in a statement yesterday, said he used this opportunity to connect the company directly to the government’s working team to get the project off the ground, which he wants to see happen within 2022 and 2023.
The meeting follows from the first he and Mr Nooy held in Singapore earlier this month during the PM’s short visit to the country days after his election.Yesterday, he reassured Mr Nooy that he stood ready to speak at the high-level arena, while directing the State Negotiating Team to work with the company in processing the mechanisms needed to get the first project off the ground.Mr Marape said he remains committed to see the relevant agencies of the State assist FFI progress this work immediately. He said he will be speaking with Fortescue founder and owner Dr Andrew Forrest and proceed in making connections to markets in countries that have existing bi-lateral relations with PNG.
“At the high-level, if you want someone to market these things for you, our government can market for you using the bi-lateral connections. We have strong relationship with China since 1975, with US at the bi-lateral level, with South Korea, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia. These are big economies,” he said.
“We are rightly placed to advocate for green energy. That is our competitive advantage.“African nations do not have this, they are too far but we are right here. And we are here to support you. We are ready to assemble a team. So by 2023, we not in concept anymore but get some project going.”
He said opportunities are available in Purari River, Gulf Province and the geothermal springs of West New Britain Province where the company has already established working sites based under two heads agreement signed between the State and FFI last year

                        Zimbabwe
Australia-based oil and gas company Invictus Energy said Friday it would next month begin exploring for gas in northern Zimbabwe.
If successful, this could lead to Zimbabwe's first gas production and could ease the country's perennial power woes.
Exploration was to start some 200 kilometres (120 miles) north of the capital Harare near the border with Mozambique at a field that is estimated to hold 20 trillion cubic feet of gas, according to Invictus.
It was previously explored by US giant Mobil Oil in the early 1990s.
""We expect to start drilling early September,"" said Barry Meikle, Invictus country manager at the site of the well in Muzarabani.
Invictus Energy signed the exploration, development and production deal with Zimbabwe in 2018.
It plans to build a gas-to-power facility to supply the national grid.
Zimbabwe is plagued by energy shortages forcing outages of up to 15 hours a day.
""We are having a power deficit in this country so if we are able to do a short-term gas-to-power project, there will be immediate benefit in terms of power generation,"" Meikle told AFP. ""It will be the start of a very big industry"".
Joe Mtizwa, vice chairman of Invictus Energy said: ""If we are successful, this project will be transformational -- a game changer for Zimbabwe.""
But environmentalists are wary.
""At the moment, the project is at its exploration stage so the impact on the environment is marginal,"" said environmentalist Farai Maguwu.
But ""when the project gets into full swing, we expect... serious environmental pollution,"" warned the founder of the Centre for Natural Resource Governance.
Maguwu said he feared that the construction of hundreds of kilometres (miles) of pipeline would displace people, as well as destroy vegetation and animal habitats.
And ""whilst natural gas is considered cleaner than coal, it still emits pollutants such as methane gas which is a deadly heat trapping gas,"" he said.

Zimbabwe: Australian gas and oil company to begin gas drilling project
                                                      The drilling site in Muzarabani, Zimbabwe, August 19, 2022.
                                                                                    -

                        Zimbabwe
Australian firm Invictus Energy announced it was going to start drilling its first well in Zimbabwe in a few days to look for gas and oil. The company thinks 20 trillion cubic feet of gas are located in this well in the Muzarabani-Mbire area, in the north, near the border with Mozambique.
""The benefits I think will be great. We are having a power deficit in this country so if we are able to do a short-term gas-to-power project, there will be an immediate benefit in terms of power generation, it will be the start of a very big industry. We will drill a lot more wells, there will be opportunities for Zimbabweans"", commented Barry Meikle, Invictus Country Manager.
The firm plans to build a gas-to-power facility to supply the national grid an attractive possibility as Zimbabwe is plagued by power shortages.
But environmentalists fear the construction of pipelines could lead to forced displacement, harm the vegetation and animal habitats.

Ethiopia starts power generation from second turbine at mega-dam
                                                       A general view of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in Guba, Ethiopia.
                                                                                    -

Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed kickstarted electricity production from the second turbine at its controversial mega-dam on the Blue Nile on Thursday, despite continuing objections by Egypt and Sudan over the project.
Abiy also confirmed that a third filling of the multi-billion dollar Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) was under way, a development that led Egypt last month to protest to the UN Security Council.
Thursday's move came even though there is still no agreement between Ethiopia and its downstream neighbours Egypt and Sudan about the GERD's operations.
Abiy insisted that the third filling of the $4.2 billion dam -- set to be the largest hydroelectric scheme in Africa -- was not causing any water shortages for the two countries.
""We have repeatedly told downstream countries, especially Egypt and Sudan, that by generating power we're developing our economy, as well as (our desire) to see our citizens who live in the dark see light,"" he said.
There was ""no aim to sideline and harm"" those countries, he added.
Ethiopia first began generating electricity at the dam in February. Currently, the two turbines, out of a total of 13 at the dam, are generating 750 megawatts of electricity.
The GERD is ultimately expected to produce more than 5,000 megawatts, more than doubling Ethiopia's current output.
Last month, Egypt wrote to the Security Council voicing its objections to Ethiopia's plans to fill the dam for a third year without a three-way agreement.
Cairo and Khartoum fear it could threaten their access to vital Nile waters and have demanded a written agreement between on the dam's filling and operation.
The process of filling the GERD's vast reservoir, which has a total capacity of 74 billion cubic metres, began in 2020.
The new US envoy for the Horn of Africa, Mike Hammer, discussed the project during visits to both Ethiopia and Egypt last month, saying Washington was ""actively engaged"" in supporting efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the dispute.
The 145-metre (475-foot) high structure straddles the Blue Nile in the Benishangul-Gumuz region of western Ethiopia, near the border with Sudan.

                        Angola
Italian hydrocarbon giant ENI, France's TotalEnergies, Britain's BP, CABGOC, a subsidiary of U.S. Chevron, and Angola's state-owned Sonangol have agreed to invest in a consortium to develop the Quiluma and Maboqueiro (Q&M) gas fields in Angola, which are expected to eventually produce 4 billion cubic meters per year by 2026.
""Eni and its Partners in the New Gas Consortium (NGC), Chevron’s affiliate in Angola Cabinda Gulf Oil Company Limited (CABGOC), Sonangol P&P, bp and TotalEnergies, together with Angola’s National Agency for Oil, Gas and Biofuels ANPG"", have taken the ""Final Investment Decision (FID) for the development of the Quiluma and Maboqueiro (Q&M) fields"", the Italian giant said in a statement Wednesday.
The project includes ""two offshore wellhead platforms"" off the northwest coast of Angolan "" an onshore gas processing plant"" as well as ""a connection to Angola LNG plant for the marketing of condensates and gas via LNG cargoes"". Operations are due to start in 2022, with a planned production launch in 2026. Production is estimated at around 4 billion m3 per year.
The consortium is controlled by ENI, which has been present in Angola since 1980, with 25.6%, Chevron CABGOC (31%), Sonangol P&P (19.8%), BP (11.8%) and TotalEnergies (11.8%).

                        Natural gas
Algerian, Nigerien and Nigerian Energy Ministers signed on Thursday a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the construction of a 4,000 gas pipeline across the Sahara Desert that will supply Europe with additional gas, the Algerian news agency APS wrote.
The Trans-Saharan Gas-Pipeline (TSGP), should send billions of cubic meters of Nigerian gas to Algeria via Niger. Algeria will then send it to the countries of the European the gas, via the Transmed which connects the country to Italy through Tunisia, and LNG (liquefied natural gas) transported by tankers.
The Algerian Minister of Energy and Mines, Mohamed Arkab, and his counterparts from Nigeria, Timipre Sylva, and Niger, Mahamane Sani Mahamadou, co-signed the memorandum of understanding in Algiers during a 3rd tripartite meeting. They first discussed aspects of the project including the status of progress, according to APS. For the moment, no indication has been given as to when the project will be completed.
When the project was launched in 2009, the investment cost of the Trans-Saharan Gas-Pipeline (TSGP) was estimated at 10 billion dollars. The pipeline spanning 4,128 km of which 1,037 km are in Nigeria, 841 km in Niger and 2,310 km in Algeria, will connect the gas fields of Nigeria, through Niger, to the Algerian border to connect to the Algerian network.
The TSGP will also allow on its way the supply of the regions of the Sahel countries. This project has been reactivated in a geopolitical context marked by strong international demand for gas and oil and a surge in prices, after the war in Ukraine erupted late February.
The North African country, whose proven natural gas reserves amount to nearly 2,400 billion m3, supplied around 11% of the gas consumed in Europe before the war in Ukraine, compared with 47% for Russia. It is the first African exporter of natural gas and the 7th in the world.

Rwanda will produce methane gas from Lake Kivu
                                                      The project involves the construction of an offshore gas extraction facility along with onshore gas processing and compression plants.

                        Rwanda
Rwanda has been exploring the use of gas from Lake Kivu for cooking, industrial use and vehicles. It is expected that the cooking gas produced from this lake could start being used by the end of 2023.
The project involves the construction of an offshore gas extraction facility along with onshore gas processing and compression plants for CNG. This comes in the wake of the global struggle of high prices of gas and fuel, currently in Rwanda, a 12-kilogramme cooking gas cylinder costs at least Rwf 18, 500, an increase of about a half, compared to Rwf12, 600 in 2020.
Africanews visited the Gasmeth company construction site near lake Kivu to examine the progress of the locally produced gas.
""It is going to be constructed in two phases, the first phase is going to be composed on one badge, the location, where we are standing now is going to be where the badge is going to be assembled, and then after it is going to be taken where the gas is going to be extracted which is approximately 30-35 km from here, Steven Manzi, GASMETH construction Manager explains.After extracting the gas, it goes through a series of verification, such that we can attain the natural gas which is the CNG gas we need. The gas will be brought via pipes, it will come below the lake and onshore.""
The $400 million deal between the Rwandan government and Gasmeth Energy Company to extract and process methane from Lake Kivu into CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) was signed in February 2019. However, it was delayed by various factors, including the outbreak covid19 pandemic.
""It’s been probably two years, looking at the aspects of the project and we have been engaged with the international investors to bring the money into the country, Stephen Tiernney GASMETH CEO reveals. Unfortunately, COVID slowed everything in the world, and it set us about 12 months behind, but we are now moving ahead, we have started initiating construction, the funding is largely there, the project should now start, and we want to see and identify physical progress.""
The Gasmeth company signed a 25-year concession agreement with the Rwandan government to extract 40 million standard cubic feet per day of natural compressed gas.

                        Morocco
Morocco announced on Tuesday the reactivation of two large power plants thanks to liquefied natural gas (LNG) transported from Spain via the Maghreb Europe Pipeline (GME), after Algiers' decision to stop supplying the kingdom with gas.
""The kingdom of Morocco ensures its natural gas supply by concluding contracts for the purchase of LNG (liquefied natural gas) on the international market and by using the gas infrastructures of Spanish operators and the Maghreb-Europe Gas Pipeline,"" according to a press release from the National Office of Electricity and Drinking Water (ONEE), the National Office of Hydrocarbons and Mines.
This LNG will be used in particular to restart the gas stations of Tahaddart and Aîn Béni Mathar, in the north of Morocco, which was previously supplied by Algerian gas.
From now on, the supply of the two power stations - which provide between 10% and 17% of the national electricity production, according to local media - is ""ensured by the GME via the Moroccan-Spanish gas interconnection operating in reverse flow mode"", the press release states.
The delivery of gas to Morocco began on 28 June ""on the basis of commercial relations and good neighbourliness"", sources in the Spanish Ministry of Ecological Transition told AFP, assuring that it was not Algerian gas.
Algeria had threatened in April to break its gas supply contract with Spain if Madrid were to send Algerian gas ""to a third destination"", an implicit reference to Morocco.
At the end of October, Algiers decided not to renew the GME contract amid escalating tensions between the two Maghreb neighbours over the thorny Western Sahara issue. Since then, Rabat has been seeking to diversify its sources of supply to cover its needs.
At the end of November, a British company Sound Energy and ONEE signed an agreement to supply natural gas from the Tendrara concession (east).
Sound Energy undertakes to produce and deliver to the country up to 350 million cubic metres of liquefied natural gas per year, over a ten-year period.

			K1.07b bailout for PNG Power

The Asian Development Bank is coming to the rescue of PNG’s long-suffering power users.It has announced a whopping K1.07 billion (US$305 million) funding to fix the country’s power issues of failing grids and transmission lines causing constant black-outs.The project will target five sub-projects within the main power grids of PNG Power Limited.
This Power Sector Development Project is supported by loans and grants from ADB and the governments of Australia and PNG.Asian Development Bank provided two loans totaling K735.2 million ($US208.6m), the Government of Australia contributed a K210 million ($59.5m) in loan and a K209.8 million ($12.8m) as grant, and the government of PNG with PPL will put in K84.9 million ($24.1m).The project will expand and upgrade transmission lines and sub-stations in Gazelle, Ramu, and Port Moresby; build new low- and medium-voltage power distribution lines in Gazelle, Ramu, and Port Moresby, and mini grids in West New Britain.
It will also strengthen the capacity of PPL through the introduction of procurement and implementation, utility operation, and financial management reforms.ADB’s Pacific Department Energy Division director, Mukhtor Khamudkhanov, said when making the announcement that the limited electricity access in PNG stifled economic growth and exacerbates poverty and inequality in both the urban and rural areas.He said COVID-19 had also impacted the local economy, and quality infrastructure was a central component of the government’s post-pandemic economic recovery strategy.
He said the stable power grids proposed under the project would help maintain urban health facilities’ basic operations and were critical to reducing COVID-19 risks.“PNG has one of the lowest rates of electricity access in the Pacific, with only 13 per cent of households having access,” Mr Khamudkhanov said.“The project will contribute to the government’s objective of connecting 70 per cent of its population to electricity by 2030 and will help advance reforms in the power sector.”The announcement comes at a time when the country’s State-owned utility company needs rescue from the ongoing issues of aging infrastructures to provide reliable power service.From a past article by this paper on the power issue, approximately K2 billion is required to replace PPL’s aging equipment and infrastructure.There is no indication as to when this project will begin.Meanwhile, a former PPL boss has said that it would take up to five years to have this aging infrastructure issues resolved.

                        Egypt
Egypt and Norway signed an agreement for several projects to enhance their cooperation in developing renewable energy on Thursday.
Cairo has been striving to launch environment-friendly projects in the lead-up to the 27th U.N. Climate Change Conference in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in November.
“The excellent relations between our countries are broad,"" Norwegian Foreign Minister Anniken Huitfeldt said at a press briefing in Cairo with Egypt’s Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry.
“They have become broader today with the signing of agreements between the Egyptian government and Norwegian renewable energy company Scatec,"" she added.
Among those who were present is Egypt's Prime Minister Mustafa Madbouly who witnessed the signing ceremony between representatives of Egypt's Sovereign Fund, the Norwegian Norfund and Scatec, Norway's leading renewable power producer.
The agreement between Cairo and Oslo foresees projects for the production of renewable energy, green hydrogen and the building of a green infrastructure in African countries.
Earlier this month, Egypt signed a $5 billion memorandum of understanding with Scatec to establish a plant in the Suez Canal area for producing green ammonia from green hydrogen.
The plant, which will be operational by 2025, is expected to produce one ton of green ammonia a year, with a potential to expand to three tons, According the Egyptian government.

Ethiopia dismisses 'rumours' Nile mega-dam will 'starve Egypt and Sudan'

                        Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam
Ethiopia began generating electricity from its mega-dam on the Blue Nile on Sunday, a milestone in the controversial multi-billion dollar project.
Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, accompanied by high-ranking officials, toured the power station and pressed a series of buttons on an electronic screen, a move that officials said initiated production.
The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) is set to be the largest hydroelectric scheme in Africa but has been at the centre of a dispute with downstream nations Egypt and Sudan ever since work first began in 2011.
Abiy described Sunday's development as ""the birth of a new era"".
""This is good news for our continent & the downstream countries with whom we aspire to work together,"" he said on Twitter.
Addis Ababa deems the project essential for the electrification and development of Africa's second-most populous country, but Cairo and Khartoum fear it could threaten their access to vital Nile waters.
Abiy, wearing sunglasses and a khaki-colored hat emblazoned with the Ethiopian flag as he toured the site, dismissed those concerns.
""As you can see this water will generate energy while flowing as it previously flowed to Sudan and Egypt, unlike the rumours that say the Ethiopian people and government are damming the water to starve Egypt and Sudan,"" he said as water rushed through the concrete colossus behind him.
But Cairo denounced Sunday's start-up, with the foreign ministry saying Addis Ababa was ""persisting in its violations"" of a declaration of principles on the project signed by the three nations in 2015.
- 'Resisting external pressure' -
The $4.2-billion (3.7-billion-euro) dam is ultimately expected to produce more than 5,000 megawatts of electricity, more than doubling Ethiopia's current output.
Only one of 13 turbines is currently operational, with an installed capacity of 375 megawatts.
A second will come online within a few months, project manager Kifle Horo told AFP, adding that the dam is currently expected to be fully completed in 2024.
The 145-metre (475-foot) high structure straddles the Blue Nile in the Benishangul-Gumuz region of western Ethiopia, near the border with Sudan.
Egypt, which depends on the Nile for about 97 percent of its irrigation and drinking water, sees the dam as an existential threat.
Sudan hopes the project will regulate annual flooding but fears its own dams could be harmed without agreement on the GERD's operation.
Both have long been pushing for a binding deal over the filling and operation of the massive dam, but African Union-sponsored talks have failed to achieve a breakthrough.
William Davison, the senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the GERD is seen domestically ""as a symbol of Ethiopia resisting external pressure"".
""The government has propagated the idea that foreign actors are trying to undermine Ethiopia's sovereignty, so I think this will be cast as showing they are still making progress despite a hostile environment.""
Addisu Lashitew of the Brookings Institution in Washington added that the GERD's commissioning was a ""rare positive development that can unite a deeply fractured country"" after 15 months of brutal conflict with Tigrayan rebels.
""The newly-generated electricity from the GERD could help revive an economy that has been devastated by the combined forces of a deadly war, rising fuel prices and the Covid-19 pandemic,"" he said.
- Project delays -
The dam was initiated under former prime minister Meles Zenawi, the Tigrayan leader who ruled Ethiopia for more than two decades until his death in 2012.
Civil servants contributed one month's salary towards the project in the year of the project launch, and the government has since issued dam bonds targeting Ethiopians at home and abroad.
But officials on Sunday credited Abiy with reviving the dam after what they claim was mismanagement delayed its progress.
""Our country has lost so much because the dam was delayed, especially financially,"" project manager Kifle said at the launch ceremony.
The process of filling the GERD's vast reservoir began in 2020, with Ethiopia announcing in July of that year it had hit its target of 4.9 billion cubic metres.
The reservoir’s total capacity is 74 billion cubic metres, and the target for 2021 was to add 13.5 billion.
Last July Ethiopia said it had hit that target, meaning there was enough water to begin producing energy, although some experts had cast doubt on the claims.
Kifle declined to reveal how much water was collected last year or what the target is for the coming rainy season.

Ethiopia's Grand Renaissance Dam starts generating power

Ethiopian prime-minister, Abiy Ahmed, described the start of power generation at the controversial Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on Sunday as a ""milestone"".
The dam, built on the Blue Nile, is set to be Africa's largest hydroelectric project once fully completed in 2024.
Only one of 13 turbines is currently operational, with an installed capacity of 375 megawatts. A second turbine is scheduled to start operating within months.
Since 2011 that the project has been at the centre of a regional dispute with Egypt and Sudan that depend on the Nile for drinking water and irrigation.
Talks held under the auspices of the African Union have so far failed to reach agreement in terms of filling and operating the dam's reservoir.
The Ethiopian prime minister dismissed concerns raised by Egypt and Sudan saying that this project is necessary for the country's electrification and development.
The dam is expected to produce more than 5,000 megawatts of electricity, more than doubling Ethiopia's electricity output.

                        Mozambique
The C.E.O of oil giant Total met with Mozambique’s president Nyusi, on Monday. His visit aimed at relaunching a gas production project suspended last year.
Mozambique’s president Filipe Nyusi met with French Patrick Pouyanné on Monday. The C.E.O of Total's visit aimed at relaunching a gas production project suspended last year. Following a jihadist attack in March 2021, Total halted operations at a site exploring a major gas field in northern Mozambique. Then the energy giant shut its operations and withdrew all staff.
The gas project was worth more than 15 billion $ but the gas-rich Cabo Delgado province has been battered by a jihadist insurgency since 2017. The violence has so far killed at least 2,600 and displaced nearly 700,000 people.  
Total Energies planned to start the production on site in 2024 but it was postponed until 2026. Patrick Pouyanné was hopeful for a return of security that would enable ""firms and residents"" to head back to the Cabo Delgado province.
Last summer, Rwanda and countries part of the Southern African Development Community sent at least 3,000 soldiers.
Mozambique doesn’t produce oil and therefore relies on imports. However, the country is one of the largest holder of gas reserves in Africa.

PNG Power limited Tari to Hides project will reduce generation cost and power disruption caused by generation shortfall for the upper Highlands centres including Mt Hagen.PNG Power Ltd (PPL) said the aim of the main project is to build the transmission network necessary to access cheap gas power from Hides to improve generation availability and reliability at the western end of the Highlands region to support generation from Pauanda and Yonki.“The outcome of the project will reduce generation cost and power disruption caused by generation shortfall for the upper Highlands centres including Mt Hagen.
Tari will no longer rely on expensive diesel generation, with a move to cleaner, cheaper, locally extracted gas-power generation.Ramu1 and Yonki hydro assets will have more available capacity to supply lower Highlands centres, Lae and Madang,” PPL stated.The PNG National Power Grid Backbone Infrastructure Project involving six provinces was originally developed to meet the growing energy requirements of major populations, enterprise and industrial resource concerns in the region.
This is a project of substantial national importance, affecting the livelihoods of millions of Papua New GuineansThe project was originally approved 6 years ago, based on transmission feasibility reports published in 2014 and after an exhaustive international tender selection process, Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co, Ltd (TBEA) were contracted to deliver phase 1 and later, phase 2 of the project.In July 2021, NEC approved the project variation to add the Tari to Hides 132kV transmission and substation project in its Decision No. 138/2021, where PPL signed a K71 million contract with Chinese TBEA Contractors for the construction of Tari to Hides high voltage transmission line.
This critical addition will strengthen and diversify the power supply to the network by connecting gas generation assets in Hides to homes and businesses.KCH is funding the K71 million project variation through a shareholder lending arrangement to PNG Power. This adds to more than K1 billion in total project funding for this vital infrastructure.
