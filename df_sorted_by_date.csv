			Wigmen Stadium under construction

The Hela Wigmen will relocate to Tari by 2025 but they will host some home games in the 2024 Digicel Cup competition as their home ground stadium would be completed by mid this year, Hela Governor Philip Undialu said.The K10 million stadium was halted by 14 months due to a legal proceeding taken against the provincial government by an Incorporated Land Group who claimed ownership of the land, although the land was outrightly purchased from the landowner.However, he said the court has directed for meditation and they would start the process by February this year, and that will not affect the construction of the stadium.“This stadium is made of steel, no scaffolding is used, only metal is used to construct the stadium seats and the foundation. It is co-funded by Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (K5m) and the Hela Provincial Government (K5m).Mr Undialu said since 2013, the Hela Wigmen has been operating in Lae and Port Moresby because they do not have a home stadium, despite winning some premiership titles.“Therefore, we have constructed our own stadium and we have to complete it before June this year and hopefully host several Wigmen home games by June,” he said.Mr Undialu said the first stage of the stadium with a capacity of 7000 seats is now under construction and the contractor, China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CECC) is working on the grandstand and is putting up the roof.“I’m happy the Stadium is taking shape. The roofing and the final touches are being done on the first stage of the stadium. The first stage will have a smaller capacity of about 7000 but that will increase in the second stage development of the stadium, which will have a total capacity of 10,000 seats. The second phase will be bigger and will have a top floor for VIPS and the media, and it will also consist of a cafeteria. The main grandstand will have a double floor,” he said.Also included in the second phase of the development will be a 50-men Wigmen Hotel, a hotel dedicated to the Wigmen, and will be managed by a management team to generate revenue for the club.The hotel will also have a swimming pool, gym and other facilities with rooms for the players while other rooms will be up for guests.The stadium will also have several kiosks to lease out, a source of revenue for the club.He said the club must raise its own funds to sustain its operation in the years to come and the Wigmen Hotel, the kiosk and the gate takings are some revenue streams for the Wigmen club they are looking at, as their current sponsor will not always be around to support the team.Governor Undialu said the Hela Provincial Government will also partner the three districts of Koroba Kopiago-Komo-Hulia and Magarima to build mini stadiums in the three districts.He said the stadium will also be used for other activities such as big church gatherings, cultural events and sporting events.

The Kokopo Central Business District’s Williams Road is gradually becoming more and more dotted with potholes.
On a busy day, the traffic stalls. Vehicles that attempt to avoid these potholes pose risks to pedestrians as they cross the main road to shops or the main market.
The main crossing from the Kokopo market to K Central supermarket is always busy and potholes have also riddled this main crossing.
A mother crossing the road to the market. The potholes on the side are steadily getting wider by the day. Pictures: PAUL BUNGTABU.
A proposed overhead bridge was talked about few years ago.
Up until today, the idea has remained a dream that has yet to be realised.
Motorists, mainly those on route 8B PMV buses, are pleading with authorities to patch the potholes, as an accident along this route is deemed unavoidable.

By TONY PALME
THE people of Jimi district in Jiwaka are forced to be tough and resilient because they have to survive in an isolated geography area.
Hamlets are mostly situated on mountain tops and gardens are located in the deep slopes beside the rivers.
Everyday is a struggle that the people are already accustomed to.
The most pressing need of the people has been accessibility to a reliable road network.
 People walking along the Last Kuipun-Por road in the Middle Jimi area of the Jimi district in Jiwaka.- Picture: TONY PALME.
Roads were earlier constructed that connected the three distinct constituencies of Upper Jimi, Lower Jimi and Middle Jimi during the reign of politicians like late Sir Thomas Kavali, the pioneer MP of Jimi, to the late James Kuru Kupul, and others.
But these roads have since withered away.
This is the challenge for MP Wake Goi who is trying to restore the former legacies by prioritising roads as the key infrastructure to unlocking the enormous agriculture and economic potential of one of the most rugged districts in the country.
The main access road into Jimi district from Banz in North Waghi is already in good condition and work is progressing towards improving it all the way to the Kol government station in Upper Jimi.
This is between 80-100 kilometres 
New Jimi district chief executive officer Andrew Kumie has further assured the people that the district development authority is doing all it can in this term to improve all roads.
Toli ward member Noliye Kaulo said the road is the lifeline of the people who rely on agriculture.
“Our people grow coffee, peanuts, red pandanus, and other cash crops.
“But it continues to be a real struggle to effectively move the produce to the markets in Banz on the current roads.
“At last, we see some hope under Kumie and Goi because we are physically seeing some excavators being moved into locations.
“We can’t wait to see our roads from Toli-Warakar and Last Kuipun-Por improved and upgraded.
“Most have passed on waiting for better roads, but in our time, it will be light at the end of he tunnel.”
People at Last Kuipun, Last Dada, Por, Maikmol, Toli –– which comprises of 11 wards and roughly 20,000 people –– will greatly benefit from the rehabilitation projects.

			P’nyang gas project after development, construction phase

BY JEFFREY ELAPA
The development forum and development and construction of the P’ynang gas project in the Western Province will come after the completion of the construction phase of the Papua LNG project.
Minister for Petroleum Kerenga Kua said while responding to questions without notice from Western Governor Taboi Awi Yoto who wanted to know when the development forum for the landowners, the provincial government, the affected LLG and the State will be conducted.
The Governor also wanted to know when the State would pass the P’ynang Gas Fiscal Stability Act to give the provincial government and the affected district development authority (DDA) access to the tune of K150 million as tax credit fund as captured in the gas agreement.
Mr Kua in his response said there are two similar projects within the same region, the Elk Antelope in Gulf and the Pynang in the Western Province, and they share the same geographical region.
Therefore, the government has sequenced the two projects, by firstly starting off with the development and the construction of the Papuan LNG project hopefully by 2024 and then move over to Pýnang, running back to back within the space of 4 years.
This means that the Development Forum for Pynanag will take place in 2027 and the construction and the development would start in 2028.
Mr Kua said this sequencing is basically to run parallel simultaneously, and that is due to the fact that the country is small with a small public service, and they cannot be engaged in two similar projects at once, as technically skilled fields like these requires a lot of work.
He said the State need not only the public servants but the skilled private sector contractors in such big projects and with a small workforce, they cannot be engaged in two major highly skilled projects concurrently.
The Minister said the other reason is for the greater benefit of the country’s economy, and that is to expand the economic benefits so the economy is sustained for a longer period and not to run concurrently and collapse the economy.

The Edevu hydro power station construction is on schedule, with all work to be completed by the end of September, 2023.
The Edevu power project, opened in April this year, will supply 54 megawatts into the Port Moresby grid with 2x turbines each producing 27 megawatts.
The current peak loan demand in Port Moresby grid is 132 megawatts.
PNG Power chairman McRonald Nale said Edevu’s bigger sized generating units with higher inertia will add stability to the Port Moresby grid.
“With Edevu, Port Moresby grid will have an improved ability to withstand electrical shocks and disturbances, thereby reducing network blackouts. 
Having high inertia machines from Edevu will significantly reduce total system outages caused by network cascading effects. 
Edevu hydro power brings clean, fuel free and low-cost power to supply increasing demand in the Port Moresby grid,” Mr Nale said.
PPL estimates about 40 to 50 megawatts are produced and utilised by large industries off grid due to reliability issues.
“With low cost power from Edevu hydro, this will improve network regulation and improved attention to our customers through a range of initiatives, including Amnesty Program and Feeder Team Management, we believe the industries not on the PPL grid will reconnect,” Mr Nale said.
PNG Hydro Development Ltd managing director Allan Guo said the total towers of the main transmission lines to be built from Edevu to the Moitaka is 104.
“Work on erecting and stringing of towers is completed from tower 1- tower 39. From tower 39 — 89, erection of towers completed without stringing. 
This week, our contractors will be working on towers 90 — 95, that is doing the foundation work and so forth,” Mr Guo said.
By the end of September, PNG Power will officially do the technical commissioning for the Edevu Hydro Power Station, and will run on full operation for three days, before final tests are done and the official commissioning takes place.

			No update on guidelines for construction of communication towers

Growth in Mobile and Telecommunication companies like Digicel Pacific and Vodafone PNG is raising concerns for regulations on location for building mobile communication towers across the country.
Digicel Pacific and Vodafone PNG recently announced their intention to increase their reach, 
spiking the need for building more telecommunication towers and to ensure that it does not interfere or pose any harm to the people, space and infrastructure.
The Post-Courier understands that there has been very little update from the National Information and Communication Technology Authority on the process for developing these regulatory guidelines to guide the construction of mobile communication towers.
NICTA released a public notice on April 29, 2022, stating that it was in consultation with the industry to develop guidelines for the construction of towers.
In the notice, NICTA issued few orders which are to be observed by the mobile network operators, tower owners and general public.
The orders issued also prohibits the construction of mobile towers within 200 metres of existing towers, schools or hospitals and in residential areas, industrial areas or near highways and main roads.
In December 2022, NICTA chief executive officer Kila Gulo-Vui, said the consultation process of developing the guidelines was under way and NICTA was engaging with the industry and city authority to develop these guidelines.
He said the industry is aware of the regulator’s expectations and they are providing their responses.
“We will go through the process and when the consultation is completed and everything is finalised, NICTA will make the announcement for the industry to be aware of,” Mr Gulo-Vui said.
He said they are currently in dialogue with concerned stakeholders on the existing towers built in public areas and which should be at least 200 metres to the existing infrastructure such as schools or hospitals and in residential, industrial areas or near highways and main roads.

 LizApril Fisa, Sharon Katari 
MORE and more women are joining building and construction trades, an industry traditionally dominated by men.LizApril Fisa and Sharon Katari are part of this new generation of women in the building and construction industry. Their stories will serve as an inspiration to other women and girls who wish to enter similar skilled technical trades in their career.Employed by Digara Construction Ltd, LizApril and Sharon are proud to be part of the company’s current project- the construction of a new 40-bed female dormitory at the University of Papua New Guinea’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences, funded by a Papua New Guinea-Australia Partnership Incentive Fund grant of K8.1 million.
Companies like Digara have seen the benefits of employing women and are keen to support and en[1]courage their female workers and provide an avenue for Papua New Guinean women to apply their trade skills.Given the project is targeted at improving access to quality education and increasing employment opportunities for women, the focus on having women construction workers participating in the building sector is welcomed.For Ms Fisa, from Tufi in the Northern Province, joining Digara was an opportunity she couldn’t pass up on. She is determined to make her mark in the industry.
“It’s kind of tough. When I first came (to this project), there weren’t any females,” Ms Fisa said.“I was like, man, how am I going to survive here? But then again, I’m the only girl in a family full of boys so, I was like, just treat them well, just like how I treat my brothers at home.“Talk to them properly and make them feel comfortable because most of these guys have never worked with a female co-worker before so it’s quite hard to communicate and talk to them.” Her collaborative approach has paid off.
“I usually initiate discussions and always put myself out there and say hey, I’m here – you need anything, you need help or whatever let me know,” Ms Fisa said.“That’s my approach.” And after being on the job as an electrical assistant for just three months, she is already noticing a shift in behaviour by her male colleagues.“They are comfortable with me being around. At first, they were like, we have a female, and we are very careful with how we speak,” she said.“Because there were no females around in the first place, they expressed themselves freely.It’s different now, they are very mindful and respectful towards us.”In fact, Ms Fisa has been inspired by her experiences on the project that she hopes to continue in the construction industry and become a licensed electrician in the future. Ms Katari from Lufa in the Eastern Highlands Province has been in the trade for a lot longer than Ms Fisa, starting with Digara four years ago as a welder.But she agrees that women face particular challenges in the industry, especially juggling working and being a mother to a two-year-old son.“I’m proud to be in this field – I wouldn’t let the opportunity go by like that. I can’t let motherhood hinder my professional career,” Ms Katari said.“There is always a balance in what I do and I’m enjoying it right now.The most important achievement for me is doing a good job and being recognised by the company I work for.”At Digara, she is responsible for assembling pieces of metal together, repairing damage in metal components as well as reviewing blueprints, cutting metal, and smoothing molten metal to remove creases.

DWU Journalism StudentThe deteriorating condition of the road connecting Kabaleo to the main Williams Road in Kokopo has become a concern.Fhox Yengaha, a lecturer at the Divine Word University OLSH Kabaleo Rabaul campus said the road needs upgrading and sealing.
“We are having difficulty with transportation and public motor vehicles are hesitant to come up due to the road conditions,” he said.Mr Yengaha said opportunist have been taking advantage of the road condition to hold up students, lecturers and vehicle.He said the road serves not only the surrounding communities, but also three institutions within the province, including the DWU OLSH Kabaleo Rabaul campus, Kabaleo Vocational, and Kabaleo Demonstration Primary School.
“These institutions are agency run institutions which have been serving the province and country for years” he said.Mr Yengaha said there has been no proper development done on the road for almost a decade.He said it is not safe for them to walk from the college down to the Kalabond field because of the ongoing holdups.
“I am urging relevant authorities, the district development authority and the provincial government to do something about it,” he said.

UPNG journalism studentThousands of people living in the Gerehu suburb in Port Moresby will for the next 12 months experience difficulties in commuting following the start of a year long road construction.After the completion of the first construction of the main area road from Gerehu stage one to stage six, another year construction work is underway in the corridors of Gerehu, along the bus stop next to the Bismillah shops.
According to Phoenix Construction who has undertaken the project, the half a mile road structure starting from the Gerehu main bus stop roundabout to the Kasia Cycle roundabout is anticipated to cause traffic congestion that will definitely impact daily commuters.Phoenix site engineer, Philimon Mondolame said the new road construction progress will depend on the funding from the National Capital District Commission.“The reason for working at one section of the road at a time is because the funding is not paid in full but in installments so the funds are released when a block of the road is completed,” he said.
Another factor that significantly affect construction is weather as periods of heavy rain hinder any progress.Mr Mondale noted that traffic is currently being controlled by blocking the road in front of Gerehu Mart in order to work on the left side of the bus stop.Once the bus stop is completed then the blockade will be shifted and normalcy should return.

It was a first of its kind in the history of the Telefomin people to access a new road.This new road from Tabubil, Western province connecting the first village, Urapmin in Telefomin district of West Sepik province was launched last Friday.The Urapmin villagers including nearby villages in the district and North Fly people, Tabubil and Kiunga turned out in numbers to witness the launching ceremony.Urapmin ward president Siniki Babeloki said it is a new beginning for them.“We have over 700 people in this village and we are so happy.“We walk for three days and nights to reach Tabubil.“We carry store goods, iron sheets, teaching materials and other things from Tabubil and walk back through the cold, foggy and rugged mountainous terrain to reach Telefomin.“Some of our people have died along this bush tracks.” he said.Mr Babeloki said seeing the machinery and trucks in the village is a joyous experience as the construction of the road means they can now reach Tabubil by truck and return home the same day.Telefomin district administrator Joshua Himina said the lack of road has been a major hindrance for delivery of services.However, this road will enable them to see more changes in the district.“New roads linking nearby villages will be done, health centres, schools and other services as well. All of these services are captured in our five -year development plan,” he said.It took six years since 2018 to construct road connecting Western and West Sepik provinces.Other eight kilometres of road construction from Urapmin village to Telefomin station will continue this month and further road construction will continue to Oksapmin rural LLG starting this year.The engineers from the contractor Ipwenz Construction Limited (IPZ), other sub- contractors with support from Ok Tedi Mine through the tax credit scheme under the Connect PNG program have helped established the road.Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, Minister for Works and Highways and Telefomin MP Solan Mirisim, Labour Minister and Rai Coast MP Kessy Sawang, Hela Governor Philip Undialu, OTML managing director Kedi Ilimbit and other dignitaries witnessed the event last Friday.

THE Mamu Kundi people of the Abelam Society of East Sepik have launched a development vessel called the Mamu Kundi Development Association (MKDA) over the weekend in Port Moresby.
The Association, an initiative of the Mamu-Kundi language speaking people of Abelam tribe from Winge in the Yangoru District and Warabung in the Maprik District, have decided to come together to forge a body to pursue their development aspirations and promote and protect their cultures.
MKDA was first mooted and formally registered in August 2023 and is grounded on Christian faith and values with the focus on implementing three sustainable development goals:
Human capital development, gender, youth and people empowerment;
Spiritual, cultural, social and community development; and
Economic wealth creation.
Some notable members of the association include the director general of NARI Dr Nelson Simbiken, Secretary of Lands Benjamin Samson as advisors, and the executive includes Brian Sam as interim chairman, Steven Maken as general secretary and other educated population in Port Moresby and Lae.
The launching was attended by all the pastors of the AOG church in Mapirik, Yangoru and Port Moresby.
Mr Sam said they will become the vessel of change through greater collaboration and partnership with the government, churches, NGOs, and development partners to implement sustainable development goals program and project initiatives for the people.
Dr Nelson said the association is grounded on the Christian faith and values, with the Catholic church and AOG church, holding hands to create a better society and a better future for their younger generation.
He said the younger children of today live on choices and the aim of the association is to plan and craft a way for the younger generation so they become meaningful members of the society.
The interim executives have appealed to all Mamu Kundi all over the country to register to become members and participate meaningfully in the development of their society. 
The second part of the launching will be done in the village so that those in the village can also participate formally to register with the organisation.
Registration is K50 and the executive officer can be contacted on 77206751 and 70229923 for more information.

			Priority to locals in Nadzab development

The Morobe Provincial Government’s proposed plan to establish Nadzab city will give first priority to locals.
Morobe Governor Luther Wenge and Lae MP and Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso envision to bring the provincial headquarter to Nadzab.
Mr Rosso said the proposed Nadzab city holds immense promise for urban development, job creation and improving living standards for the citizens of Morobe.
“As the Minister for lands, I want to assure the landowners and the people of Morobe that we will work together in more consultation so a good city can be designed to benefit everyone; so that the people of Wampar and Nadzab are not left out as in previous experiences.”
He assured the locals that they will take the forefront in all the activities and development of Nadzab city.
He said the same spirit of friendship and collaboration between State, private sectors and development partners to build the Nadzab airport is expected to drive the proposed Nadzab city development.
“The core principal is to ensure that benefits are shared equitably between all stakeholders, including customary landowners, so that you have a win-win situation. We are not just talking, the money is actually sitting in the budget already,”
Governor Wenge said the new Nadzab Tomodachi Terminal is constructed at the site where the Morobe government has decided to bring its provincial and administration headquarters, and that fits in very well.
“I want to tell the Morobe people that we will close down the headquarters in Lae and establish it at Nadzab to fit with the international terminal,” he said.
He also called on the National Government to give back the old Nadzab Terminal to the Morobe government to manage.
The leaders were speaking at the opening of the new Nadzab Tomodachi International Airport this month.

What development models we are pursuing in Papua New Guinea will have a lot to say about why changes the people expect are not happening fast enough. The country has many challenges including poor management, finance and connectivity. But let’s hope that politics as the means to deliver goods and services is not being confused with the accepted models known world wide. We can have plans but they must align with the accepted models. There is no way self-made models will work for a country so let’s get that straight.Geographers will likely tell you that that the system of modernisation is:– Economic Base– Urbanisation, and,– Industrialisation – in that order.
There are examples of countries that followed this model. They are:– Great Britain – barley as its economic base– United States of America – cotton, and,– Japan – fish.
NATION BUILDINGFrom the economic base, urbanisation spreads and when population reaches 300,000 or more cities are declared, ushering in industrialisation. Value of real estate must also reach one billion before a city can be declared. Industrialisation occurs with the growing needs of the population which is a key factor. In Indonesia, many industries are run by companies from Taiwan. Taiwan is a high-tech country; they don’t have the population so the captains of industry went to Indonesia, a populous country. In mainland China, there are many Taiwanese corporations in the manufacturing sector and China as we know is the most populous nation on earth.The Western Highlands Capital, Mount Hagen became Papua New Guinea’s third city with coffee which was the economic base. Coffee, by the way was first introduced in Laloki and then went to a place called Gewoto near Popondetta. But like the slippery eel, people could not contain it and coffee went to the Highlands to become the giant it is today. The swampy Waghi Valley was drained and coffee was introduced. For Mount Hagen, the coffee stronghold was in what is called Jiwaka Province today where there were several plantations and dozens of low input – high output models. Plantations have big overheads so size matters. 
Picker harvesting coffee in the Highlands
But for the latter model, size is below plantation level – typically 15,000 trees – or six hectares (eqv of three football fields) hence the low overheads. The name of the model says it all.
ECONOMIC BASESWhen you try to figure out why economic bases are not being set up with cash crops, politicians seem to be fighting for economic bases for PNG’s best-known commodities – coffee, cocoa, copra and rubber. The land is blessed with good soil and climate so the potential is many – spices – including vanilla. But until they realise what is good for the country, there won’t be better policies and practices; there will still be squabbles for control. It does not have to be; put the country first so the economy will grow. We must make the paradigm shift by not worrying about ‘what’s there for me’ and get on with making the decisions. The people and the country are held to ransom when leaders sit on improvements for their people/districts.When urbanisation comes, it basically means reliable water and electricity. Papua New Guineans badly need the two. But despite the obvious need, leaders would rather sit on them.This is bad leadership. Our land and people have not made much progress in terms of lifting living standards because we don’t seem to understand where it is that we want to go; we’re depending on our own judgment which is unsustainable and will not work in the long run.The only way forward to deal with bad politics and poor leadership is to reform parliament which is the number one development agency. Unless we understand the development models, we will not get our priorities right when we enter public office. Many people in this regard are running for public office for the wrong reasons and bringing everybody down.
HYPOCRISYPapua New Guinea has tried the system of provincial governments but autonomy is a farce. Waigani still wields control over resources and national politicians are wary of provincial and Local Level Government presidents. This explains why there is disparity in personal emoluments and other perks and lurks. If the reforms were honestly intended, the provincial governments and the Local Level Governments would be successful. But that too is held back by insecurity. And what is the bottom line? People suffer of course.This is bad politics and rubbish leadership. Although everyone agrees that 80 per cent of the country’s population and the resources are in the provinces, funding support from Waigani does not show this. And who are we fooling? Ourselves of course. It is not the people; they are busy getting on with their lives. So, this is one hypocrisy that bedevils the country.When we talk about lifting the quality of life, we mean taking the people out of poverty and giving people improved lifestyle. Economic bases leading to urbanisation will bring this about. In Port Moresby one wonders what the economic base is. Water and electricity is not available in an environment where industrialisation is taking place. So whose model is this and what is it called? Piped water has reached ATS but there is no electricity. When the rest of the city is grappling with hypocrisy, those that are yet to receive power will wait for the decision of someone in charge. There is no plausible explanation in some of these cases so it takes us back to the waiting game.
REFORM PARLIAMENTIn other democracies women are doing well in national politics and running very large corporations successfully so this is the kind of reform we need to make and better ourselves. There are only two reasons why we are denying ourselves this leap forward; we are afraid of our shortcomings or we love bad politics, which is about self-interest and dishonesty. We also don’t want to believe that as long as women are mistreated, there will be no progress.It is refreshing to hear Kokopo being called city. The economic base of the Gazelle Peninsula is cocoa and copra. They were the first in Papua New Guinea to get into the cash economy but they did not have the population. Japan wanted to set up a fish cannery but the District Commissioner of the time, Rabbie Namaliu did not allow it. His reason was that he feared the rest of Papua and New Guinea would resent the Tolai.The Lands Advisor, a woman, was asked about their urbanisation plan. She said the plan was to connect all places with roads and put in water and electricity. Is that how you want to have the population to qualify for city status? Was the question. She grinned from ear to ear. The whole province would eventually become a city.
INNOVATIONIn the Gazelle Peninsula, politicians and pubic servants work together. Nearly all of them are Tolai so they know that change and progress is about improving themselves. They live in villages or if in government housing, they will eventually return to the village. It is about benefiting from what you put in when you have the opportunity. Let us stop talking about people as if we are somehow different from them.There are families, clan members and the tribe. The moral decay has gone unchecked for so long, values and beliefs have diminished to the extent where bad behaviour is rampant.The simplicity of this truth is escaping many leaders of today. Our ancestors who were no college graduates did not have this problem; the proof is in the Constitution which they gave us.The reason why we have not improved the quality of life for many of our people is our mindsets or attitude. How about making a life-altering discovery? Go to a rich country that became poor and is riddled with war and famine. The question of the times is: Where are we heading? Is it good? How important that question is this; the future Papua New Guineans will say, this is what our forbears left for us.That future is in the hands of today’s Papua New Guineans; tomorrow begins today.

Gwadede primary school is now an inspiration to its students in rural Rabaraba in the Milne Bay province.
The remote school in the Daga Rural Local Level Government area was built and established by the villagers.
The role the villagers played is being seen as a drive to progress development projects in the area.
It began as a pilot satellite school to Aragip Primary School in 2010.
This was initiated by the village community because the distance to the nearest school was miles away.
Gwadede primary school now serves four villages.
Since the development of the school, this has led to the installation of a proper water supply, building a school market and now a carpentry vocational school.
Gwadede Primary School market in front with the teacher’s permanent houses in the background. – Picture: supplied.
Village projects spokesman, Sam Denny said that the community built that school with K10,00 that they raised.
They managed to lure a teacher from a school from a nearby village and eventually the school was granted registration as a lower primary in 2012 and then later developed its upper primary in 2019.
Mr Denny said that there was no government funding at the start until the former Alotau member Charles Abel discovered the then satellite school.
Mr Denny said: “To get to Gwadede village, it is a three to four hour ride on a dinghy from Alotau to Rabaraba station.
“From there it takes a day or two to walk to the village,” he said.
The village is situated in a mountainous area and walking is the normal mode of transport.
“That day, that the former MP found our village, it was showering and misty so the helicopter that he was taking him to Agaun (another village in Rabaraba) was forced to make an emergency landing in our village,” Mr Denny said.
Mr Denny added that was the first time that the village had received the local MP.
“Mr.Abel upon learning about the establishment of the school, made a K100,000 commitment to help run the school and a further K50,000 to build the teacher’s houses.
“This was truly a great help to us as we no longer worried about our children spending four days away from their parents in the other villages for the purpose of getting educated.
The school chairman Iruman Seret since then they have been strategising to ensure conducive facilities for their students learning.
Today, they have five permanent classrooms, four permanent teachers’ houses, a market and access to water.
Mr Seret, who is a trademan, is now leading their new vocational school which has been helping them in their projects, but is yet to get the school registered.
He says the community works with an attitude to “participate from nothing and build in the process to learn and leave to serve our fellow men.”

BY BARNEY ORERE
borere@spp.com.pgARTICLE 32
FOOTPRINT SERIESThe Government is pursuing three major policy areas of health, education and infrastructure.
The aim is to lift the standard of living of all Papua New Guineans. We have the chance of a life-time to achieve this with the development of LNG.
Here is a thumb nail sketch of how education in this country evolved to provide further insight to understanding the challenges in education today.PRE-INDEPENDENCE
Education in PNG was controlled primarily from outside the country. Firstly the managers and administrators were primarily expatriates, with few Papua New Guineans involved in the decision making process.Secondly, the missionaries, who had a great deal of influence, especially in the villages, controlled the school curriculum in the early development of schools. After the control of the two territories was handed over to Australia in 1942, the New South Wales Department of Education curriculum was later introduced and adapted to PNG Primary Territory Schools from 1946.
Significant growth of education and of government involvement in education did not come about until after World War II when the Department of Education was established in 1946.The Foot Report (1962) was the turning point in the provision of education in the territory. It criticized the Australian Government for not producing skilled manpower to eventually rule the country. Following the report, secondary education was offered for the first time.The Administrative College was opened in 1966. Education was provided in a speedy process for both primary and secondary sectors.
Funding for education from the Australian Government provided what educationalists called “Deliberate Education” (1961-70). In 1970, the Papua New Guinea Education Ordinance was established.It called for a uniform education system and incorporated Government and Mission education and specific powers were finally laid.EARLY POST- INDEPENDENCE
The National Education system did not change significantly when PNG gained independence in 1975. The major changes were the detachment of elementary education from the National Education system. The structure of the system still comprised four main levels; primary, lower secondary, upper secondary and tertiary.The system continued its focus on the development of human resources and as such became more selective.
There was more emphasis placed on passing exams to progress to higher levels of education, resulting in low levels of accessibility to the system. Little attention was given to relevant education for the majority who were pushed out of the system and had to return to the villages.Sir Hubert Murray introduced a number of educational policies (Governor, 1904-1940). Compulsory attendance was introduced but failed due to a number of reasons. There weren’t many schools, they were not located close to villages and the crucial factor was the indigenous people failed to recognize the importance of formal education.The second policy was the development of technical education in Papua. This policy, according to historians was “ambitious and offered in a suspicious manner,” when the government could not provide elementary education at the time. The motive again was to produce indigenous people for a cheap and docile labour force. However, this policy did not eventuate and flourish due to lack of finance and support from Australia.The next policy was focused upon agricultural education. It could now be seen that the colonial administration aimed to make Papuans plantation workers at the expense of proper education. Furthermore, the Papuan administrators ignored the academic potential of indigenous people to become doctors, pilots, nurses, lawyers and other white-collar jobs.HISTORY OF FORMAL EDUCATION IN PNG
Education shapes the destiny of a nation. The problems and achievements of current education policy can only be appreciated in relation to the history of educational development in the country.Tracing the historical development of our education system and reflecting on the findings is therefore an important step in understanding the current direction of education in the country.MISSION EDUCATION
Missionaries were one of three groups that managed Papua New Guinea in the colonial era. Their aim for Papua New Guinea was Evangelisation. The introduction of literacy and primary education was primarily to translate the Bible and spread their religion to convert the indigenous people to Christianity.
Other aims included:
– To bring to civilization through the teaching of western morals, beliefs and values;
– To create self-reliant Christian communities and to protect the locals from settler exploitation,
– To produce pastors, catechists, teachers and skilled artisans in mission work.In 1875, missionaries, George Brown and Benjamin Danks, from the Methodist Missionary Society started a school at Kinawanua on Duke of York Islands in German New Guinea. Reverend George Brown published the first book in Duke of York Island dialect. Then in 1886, the first Lutheran school started in Finschaffen. However, reports reveal that the Lutheran Mission struggled to understand the people, culture and master the Finsch language. Unsatisfactory attempts were made to start schools and instructing the convincing youths to stay indoors was a difficult task.In German New Guinea, Lutherans adopted Kote and Yabim languages. The Methodists in New Britain finally decided to use Kuanua: In 1890, the London Missionary Society adopted Motu in the south coast of British New Guinea. Between 1891 and 1895, the first book in Suau language in Samarai was published.In 1896, Fr Limbrock of the Catholic Mission thought that the best solution to diversity of languages in the north coast of Madang was to use German. In 1901, on Yule Island, a formal school was started by French missionaries for the children and called it Christian Education. While reporting to the HQ, a missionary stated that the future of the station depended on good Christian education. In 1909, Catholic schools in Madang were teaching in German language.PHILOSOPHY OF PNG EDUCATION
This philosophy is based on awareness of human potential and the willingness to develop this potential so that each individual can solve his or her problems, contribute to the common good of society and maintain and improve and living.The philosophy presumes the goodness and dignity of every person and so calls for the promotion of self and mutual respect, a sense of self- worth and self-discipline, and a sense of responsibility for oneself and for others. The ultimate goal of this philosophy is for every person to receive an education which results in integral human development.The Philosophy of Education for Papua New Guinea emerged from the Five National Goals and Directive Principles contained in the National Constitution:-
– INTEGRAL Human Development,
– EQUALITY and Participation,
– NATIONAL Sovereignty and Self-Reliance,
– NATIONAL Resources and Environment,
– PAPUA New Guinea Ways.NEXT: THE STORY OF OUR DISCOVERY AND POSSESSION

A new district office complex built by the former MP for Kerowagi, Bari Palma’s administration stands proudly in the heart of Kerowagi town. The complex awaits its official opening, two years on after it was completed.A new Police station build by former two – term MP, the late John Kamb in his term in 1997 – 2002 stands at the entrance to the town, from which the local policemen are delivering law and order services to the people.Forty-eight years on from 16th September 1975, these two landmark structures are the only “development” that are seen in this little district centre, apart from some new classroom infrastructure added to the Kerowagi Secondary school over the years to absorb the growing intake of students.Today the town road infrastructure has broken up, nature has reclaimed some parts of the town while residents are making gardens here. The few small trade stores sell everything from food stuff to household goods representing the only economic activities in the town.All in all, this leaves the general impression that Kerowagi is regressing, not progressing.For a district that is connected to the Highlands Highway, grows much of the coffee coming out of Simbu Province for decades, holds the record for the highest number of PHD degree holders produced from the province and hosts Kerowagi and Kondiu, Rosary Secondary Schools – two of the biggest schools in the country – there is nothing much happening in Kerowagi district to indicate development.Like what we are doing here for Kerowagi district, development projects and programs on the ground in the districts are used as the development indicators and from our observations, there is really nothing much on the ground everywhere except for a few exceptional districts.If we go back 50 years to the day when this country was being colonised, the Kiap in those days was someone to be respected and feared, depending on the circumstances.A one man power house, the Kiaps wielded wide-ranging powers as district administrators, policemen, magistrates, goalers, engineers, surveyors, medical officers, dentists, lawyers, and agriculturalists, teachers and many more.Operating in an impossible country, with poor transport and communication infrastructure and among illiterate communities, they were the men on the spot, delivering government projects and programs to prepare PNG for self-rule and finally independence in 1975.Today, the District Managers or Chief Executive Officers in the districts have taken over the role of the Kiaps and each have their own administrations, connected to the bigger provincial administration, which is further connected to the country’s public service machinery.There is off course improved transport and communication infrastructure and the population in the districts are educated. Money, advice and other resources should flow through this channel to drive development in districts and engaging with all stakeholders should not be a problem.The governments over the years have recognised the important role district administrations play in the delivery of government services and also the need for structural and legislative reforms to ensure the districts deliver services effectively and efficiently. The cases in point are the District Development Authority Act and the Provincial Health Authority Act.Consequently, millions of Kina are going to the districts and combined with the changes to the governance and management structure in the districts and there should be noticeable progress in the districts.What is the problem here?

Jimi MP Wake Goi is determined to see the first 15 kilometres of road from the border of Jimi and North Waghi to Wara Molu bridge is sealed.
He wants to see the sealing extended to Karap Junction in middle Jimi during this term of parliament.
Mr Goi said roads and bridges are two priority programs that will be undertaken by Jimi District Development Authority among other projects.
He said one of the major road constructions will be done between Kol local level government (LLG) and Ambullua.
“This road is non-existent and I plan to launch the Jimi DDA earthmoving equipment next month to start the project.
“More than 20,000 people of Ambullua will soon have access to this very vital road infrastructure,” Mr Goi said.
He said the people living in this part of the remote district will for the first time have access to the outside world.

A THIRTY-six kilometre Ring Road Project in the Rigo North LLG of Rigo District in Central Province has been completed by Koia Investment Company Limited.
The Ring Road will now serve 20 council wards of North Rigo LLG who have been suffering from lack of better road access for the last 27 years. The Ring Road project was funded by the Central Provincial Government under the works program.
Present during the completion of the road last Sunday (27th August) were ), respective community leaders of Rigo North owner of the construction company Biari Ubuna, Acting Police Station Commander of Kwikila police station, Sergeant Bobby Ogara and a representative from the Rigo district development authority.
A community Leader Murray Gini thanked the constructor and the Central provincial government for providing the needed service to the 17, 000 plus population of Rigo North.
“The 20 council wards in the hinterland of Rigo District gratefully accolade praise to the management of KICL for the construction of Sivitatana – Wiga road connection,” Gini said.
“The road has been cut off for public use for about 27 years ago, which in other words can be put as political negligence for the last 5 terms by the previous governments.
“The Prime Minister James Marape declared the Rigo Inland Ring Road as Yagabo Highway when he was invited at Boregaina Village in late 2020 and he had announced K27 million for the road project.
In proceed to that announcement, this portion of the road was not accounted for and this has led our people to uncertainty of the effectiveness of government commitments.
“The people of Rigo North wish to give special thanks and accord to KICL, our sincere appreciation for the great achievement in bringing the road home to us.”
Biari thanked the leaders and people of Rigo North for working together with the constructor and successfully completed the project.
“The constructor is not here to make money but to deliver the needed service to the people of Rigo North.
Even though the scope of the road project ends at Dilikomana village, yet we have continued further for about 8 kilometres to Matanatou Sub Health Centre to fully connect the Ring Road. 
It took us two and half months to complete the road.”
Biari further acknowledged and thanked the Central provincial government for making the funding available to complete the Ring Road project.

			Bosavi road work underway

The noise of machines bulldozing and cutting into the thick virgin forest to build the first road into the landlocked and remote Bosavi local level government in the Nipa-Kutubu district is in indeed a 48th Independent Anniversary gift for these people in that part of the country.
Walking and hauling cargo on their backs like camels for days through thick forest and tough rugged terrains from Hidinia village in the Lower Foi in the Kutubu LLG to Mt Bosavi has been the normal practise for the people, when they did not have the money to pay for the expensive airfares from Mt Hagen.
The local MP Dr Billy Joseph has become the saviour of this forgotten people, when he and his district development authority decided to give these forgotten people an early 48 years Independence Anniversary gift.
Reality came to he fore when the first machine started working on the road to give access to the more than 20 000 people.
Thanks to Dr Joseph, the Bosavi road construction started on Monday this week when the first machine started to cut into the thick jungles to open up access.
More than 20 000 people live in this part of the area and despite being isolated, they made headlines recently on the kidnapping incidents.
Dr Joseph said the Nipa-Kutubu District Development Authority (NKDDA) with assitance from the Mt Bosavi LLG and the Kutubu LLG have injected the initial finding of K7million to start the construction of the road with no assistance from the Provincial and National Governments.
“Today is a historic and milestone occasion when the first machine started punching road into the landlocked communities.
“Our people live in poverty and have endured the hardships in life for almost 48 years since Independence with an absence of a road connectivity,” he said.

			Projects roll on as Belt and Road Initiative reaches milestone

China’s Belt and Road Initiative has gained momentum since its commencement 10 years ago in 2013.
Initially it had a regional focus but rapidly expanded beyond central Asia towards the Middle East, Africa, South America, Eastern Europe and the Indo Pacific regions, making it the biggest such program since the Marshall Plan after World War II.
Logically, there was a sharp increase in the number of projects, total investments committed and executed, and the number of countries joining as partners. 
The current number of countries and organizations stand at over 150.
China stressed that the BRI was a new model for partnership, trade and integration that was free from hegemonic pressures and conditions. Later the principles of multilateralism, environment and sustainability were embedded in the BRI.
The West, fearing China’s rapid influence through the BRI, came up with competing initiatives such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (G7), the Global Gateway (EU), the Quality Infrastructure Investment Program (Japan), and others, but their ability to rival the BRI in scale is yet to be established.
As PNG joined these 150 other countries and organizations in Beijing this month to review their involvements in the BRI, the Post-Courier takes a brief look at three projects that have been rolled out in PNG under the auspices of the BRI.
PNG National Power Grid Phase One Project
The PNG national power grid, which includes a 132kV transmission and substations for Mt Hagen, Mendi, Tari, represents the first collaborative energy infrastructure endeavor between PNG and China under the Belt and Road Initiative.
This project closely aligns with PNG’s national energy strategy, which aims to increase electricity accessibility from the current 15% to 70% by 2030 and ultimately transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
The project is funded by the China Exim Bank and executed by the contractor TBEA Co., Ltd.
The project owner is PNG Power, the project scope consists of the construction of four new 132kV substations (Mt. Hagen, Pauanda, Mendi, and Tari) and a 180-kilometer 132kV transmission line connecting these substations.
Upon completion, it significantly increased the power grid coverage, effectively alleviated energy shortages, and greatly improved grid stability and reliability in the Highlands region.
The project directly benefits residents of the three Highlands provinces (Western Highlands Province, Southern Highlands Province and Hela Province) and provides power to adjacent mining projects, including gold and copper mines.
Consequently, it will efficiently stimulate economic growth in those regions connected by the power grid. 
This initiative can also meet the electricity demands of millions of households and residents, thus improving the quality of life for local communities.
PNG National Submarine Cable Network Project
Before 2015, due to the complex geographical environment and insufficient transportation infrastructure, internet access remained relatively expensive in PNG, with only about 12 percent of PNG residents connected to the internet.
There was no backbone network in PNG. The backbone communication network between islands was mainly low-bandwidth and high-cost transmission network such as satellite and microwave. The bandwidth was limited.
New services such as high-speed mobile Internet could not be launched. 
With the development of the local economy, the existed bandwidth could not meet the market requirements.
The PNG National Submarine Cable Network Project (NSCNP) was implemented by PNG DataCo Ltd, a wholesale subsidiary of Kumul Telikom Holdings and a State-owned commercial entity.
This project was one of the high priority projects included in the Framework Agreement on Development Cooperation between China and PNG signed on July 8, 2016. 
The project was financed by EXIM Bank and was completed in June 2020.
This project was a 5457km submarine fiber cable network project connecting 14 major cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang and Lae. 
The submarine fiber cable connects to Jayapura in Indonesia.
At the same time, 14 submarine cable landing sites were built in 14 cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang, and Lae, to install submarine cable terminal equipment and network access equipment. 
Two data centers were also built in Port Moresby and Madang, used for supporting the operation of submarine cable services.
Project Benefits
Firstly, the project has improved the bandwidth, reliability and stability of PNG’s domestic network.
It helped reduce the internet pricing by introducing competition mechanism;Secondly, the project connects PNG to China through Indonesia. 
The submarine cable has become an important international network channel for the South Pacific island countries;
Thirdly, the project drives the digital economy to help the country’s socio-economic progress and development.
Juncao and Upland Rice Project
Early in 2000, Fujian Province of China and Eastern Highlands Province of PNG signed a sister province agreement and listed Juncao and upland rice technology as the aiding technology to Eastern Highlands Province by Fujian Province. 
This project was carried out by the team of Prof. Lin Zhanxi from Fujian University of Agriculture and Forestry (FUAF). This project is now in its fourth phase.
In November 2018, during President Xi’s visit to PNG, leaders of the two countries witnessed the signing of the project, the first phase of which started in August 2019 and ended in August 2022. 
In February 2022, the two countries signed the second phase of the project, which will be implemented over a three-year period from September 2022 to August 2025.
Project Implementation
The project has overcome the difficulties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, and has overfulfilled the tasks of the project in the fields of training, demonstration, production and extension.
In total, 27 technical training courses have been held, and a total of 2,921 people have been trained; Juncao mushroom, Juncao animal husbandry, and upland rice planting have been promoted to 17 districts in nine provinces, with a total of more than 10,000 farmers and 40,000 people benefiting from the project; and set the world record for highest output of pennisetum giganteum (Juncao grass), which was 8.53 tons per hectare.
Eastern Highlands Province has listed the Juncao and upland rice industries as the second and third major agricultural industries to be developed after the coffee industry.
Achievements and impact of project implementation
The project has benefited many farmers in PNG and improved the agricultural skills level of the farmers. 
It became a model of Belt and Road Initiative cooperation between China and PNG, and played a very important role in deepening the development cooperation between the two countries and the sister-province relationship between Fujian and Eastern Highlands provinces.
The project team has provided local farmers with 1,226,700 Juncao mushroom tubes, and more than 1,725 farmers have participated in the cultivating Juncao mushroom.
The farmers mainly produce oyster mushroom and sell the harvested fresh mushroom to supermarkets, local market and supermarkets in Port Moresby.
Zaka Abori, a woman mushroom farmer, started growing mushroom in February 2020 with the help of Chinese experts and selling them through supermarkets, Facebook and social media.
The profit of growing mushroom are 20-30 times higher than her original cabbage cultivation, and the expansion of her earnings has allowed her to independently set up a tube production workshop, and her Juncao mushroom business is booming.
Farmers have planted more than 130 hectares of Juncao grass, and 1798 households have raised chickens, pigs, sheep, cows and other livestock using Juncao grass, significantly reducing their costs. 
In 7 districts including Goroka, Lufa, Hengenofi, Unggai Bena, Daulo and Kainantu, the project has promoted upland rice cultivation over 1215 hectares, and has supported more than 20 large upland rice producers and cooperatives, and promoted 7604 growers, which has brought great economic benefits to the local community.
The implementation of the project has promoted the development of Juncao, livestock and upland rice industries in PNG through technical training and demonstration, and opened up a new way for increasing employment and farmers’ income, as well as environmental protection, coping with climate change and sustainable development in PNG.

BY CLAUDIA TALLY
The K117 million four-lane road from 9 Mile to Pacific Adventist University was finally launched yesterday and will open doors for economic growth and connectivity between the people of Central province to the National Capital District.
Prime Minister James Marape and NCD Governor Powes Parkop, along with other members of parliament officially cut the ribbon yesterday afternoon after three years of construction declaring the road open.
Mr Marape said roads in the nation’s capital and all across the country allow for the growth of economy especially for small subsistence farmers who depend on proper road access to take their produce to markets. He urged locals and residents to fully utilise the full potential of this road.
“Roads carries the economy and not the other way around. Road and enabling infrastructures carries the economy and today under the flagship program of the Connect PNG program we are punching roads to places that have never seen roads before and not just the nation’s capital,” stated Mr Marape.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop also highlighted that the road offers an economic corridor for the people of Central province into the city thus connecting the farmers to the market and the city to the educational hub that lies within the 9 mile to 14 mile area.
“This road holds great significance for our city and for our country. It serves a vital artery connecting the commercial part of our city to what I say the educational hub of our city.
“As we witness the completion of this infrastructure project we affirm our commitment to the transformation of Port Moresby to a truly national capital,” he stated.
The four lane road was constructed by a local construction company Mobile Works. The ground breaking ceremony was held in 2020 and it was funded by the BSP Financial Group Limited at the guarantee of the national government.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Marape urged locals along the road to use the road for their economic benefit as well as to take proper care of the road.
“This road must return its investment to the country. I want to ask all our citizens to take ownership of this road. Don’t spit and litter on this road.
“Your government will work to give fines and penalties. It must start in the nation’s capital, live life, drive must be fitting of a modern infrastructure. No time for recklessness,” he warned.

THE East New Britain provincial department of works and highways and experts from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) have jointly conducted training on preliminary research for road repair projects.The two-week training in Kokopo started on February 14 and ended on March 3.It was a technical exchange and aimed to raise institutional capacity. The training covered necessary practical skills such as surveying to guide construction manner based on preliminary road design and quantity estimation, among others.
It comes as part of the partnership between the PNG government and JICA for the Project for Capacity Development on Road Maintenance Phase 2 (CDRM2).ENB provincial works manager Amos Fimimba commended the move by JICA to work with the provincial works.“It was a great opportunity to work with other officers and learn about the challenges being faced with roads in the province,” he said.
Mr Fimimba said the significant part of the training is getting the basics right from the utilisation of construction machine and survey construction.“This training will aid us to utilise our equipment to build better quality roads in the province and the country.”The works division consisted of civil staff, operators and mechanics of equipment.

By MICHAEL KOMATHE responsibility is on the district development authorities to maintain roads in their respective districts.Chuave man Simon Gunua said this after seeing many potholes on the 13 kilometre Chuave-Movi road in the limestone-riddled district.
He said the road was sealed in 2007 by a road construction company with funding made available under the PIP “but successive DDAs and the Simbu Provincial Government had failed to maintain the stretch.He said the National Government has saved Chuave’s district service improvement program (DSIP) allocation by financing that particular road infrastructure project “so the DDA should patch the potholes and rehabilitate deteriorated
portions”.Gumine man Urmil Sine has echoed similar sentiments saying the Kundiawa-Gumine road also needs maintenance, and gave examples of deteriorating portions and potholes on the 43 kilometre stretch.
The road was sealed with funding allocated by the same source in 1998 when Aulkupa Patrick was the local MP.Mr Sine said: “Hardly any maintenance was carried out on the district’s major trunk road since bitumen was applied 22 years
ago.”Four men in Eastern Highlands remote Okapa and Lufa areas have also called on their DDAs to allocate funds for the Korefeigu-Lufa and the Korefeigu-Okapa station roads that serve an estimated 110,000 people.
Tribal and youth leaders in Gembogl, Kerowagi (Chimbu), Nondugl and Banz (Jiwaka), Mul-Baiyer and Tambul-Nebilyer (Western Highlands) and Porgera (Enga) have also expressed similar concerns.They called upon their respective DDAs to maintain sealed (trunk) roads in the districts to enable smooth flow of traffic from the rural areas to urban centres.

 ???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
BY JOAN BAILEYA further K100 million has been committed by the Marape–Rosso Government to upgrade existing roads in Lae, the industrial capital of Morobe, in the coming years.Deputy Prime Minister and Lae MP John Rosso revealed this during the official launching of the Chinatown (Bumbu) Malahang road on Monday.
He said industrial roads and priority interior roads within the city will be considered under this funding because standard and good road condition are needed to complement the major developments in the city.Mr Rosso said this funding is expected to be made available by next year for more road construction, adding that as the Lae MP, his role is to secure funding and ensure it is available to the Department of Works and contractors to upgrade roads.“Funding is not easy to secure as all MPs, governors and development sectors are competing for a share of the funding from the National Government.
But I will try my best to maintain close consultation with Works and Highways Minister Solan Mirisim and secretary David Wereh, so hopefully we get some funding.“I am happy that our main road from Unitech to Tent City has been concreted followed by the Chinatown to Malahang Industrial Centre section of the Independence Drive,” he said.Mr Rosso said upgrading is now taking place on Mongola Street to a concreted high standard road.
He said plans are in place to secure funding for upgrading of Tent City to Busu Bridge and Second Seven dump to Bumayong roads to concrete roads in his second term in parliament.“Butibam to Kamkumung road will also be upgraded to concrete, while Kamkumung Bridge will be replaced with a new bridge to cater for four lanes.“Yalu Bridge has been contracted out already and work will begin soon to replace it with a new four lane bridge to complement the four lane Lae-Nadzab Highway.”Mr Rosso said in the last three years, the Pangu-led government has spent K3 billion on road constructions and they are committed to making roads accessible to the bulk of the population in the country.He also mentioned that the K400 million Yalu-Nadzab four-lane road project has been contracted out and work is progressing.

BY CLAUDIA TALLYThe increase in population and the expansion of the capital city over time has called for the development of the city’s road network with a current investment of over K100 million by the National Capital District Commission.The NCDC at present has four new projects, six rehabilitation projects and pothole repair works around the city underway.
Acting City Manager Ravu Frank disclosed to Post-Courier that: “NCDC has contracted seven companies to do the rehabilitation or construction works and engaged nine contractors for the pothole patching programs in the city.“It is hard to tell at this stage as the value of work will depend on the progress of works, but we estimate that our investments in 2022 on various roads will be around K100 million including sealing and construction.”The new projects undertaken by the NCDC and currently underway include:
– 9 Mile to Laloki road;
– 9 Mile to Pacific Adventist University road;
– Gerehu roads; and
– Waigani Drive.
The rehabilitation works are under way at 8-Mile, Erima Wildlife, 9-Mile, Gerehu, Boroko and the Korobosea areas.The road developments, construction and maintenance are all in line with the National Capital District Commission’s urban development plans.The biggest of these jobs is the 9-Mile to Laloki road costing a total of K61,797, 258 with plans to diverge into a four lane highway linking the Goldie area as part of the government’s ‘Connect PNG’ program as captured in previous reports in the Post-Courier.
While the current NCDC administration did not share plans for new projects coming up, former city manger Bernard Kipit according to an article in the Post-Courier said in 2020 during the launching of the 9-Mile to Laloki road that two new road constructions from 14-Mile to Bautama and from Bush Wara to Dogura will follow suit.

 BY GORETHY KENNETHThe Marape/Basil Government aims to connect PNG’s missing links through its Connect PNG Road Program when it turns 50 years in 2025.
Works Secretary David Wereh and his team are now making sure all the roads in the Northern and Highlands regions get connected.He said the Department of Works and Implementation is implementing the program, with engineering and construction of key missing links – Angoram, Bogia, Morobe, Gulf and Central Milne Bay – and the improvement of existing highways, including the Mamose coastal highway, Ramu highway, Highlands Highway, Wau highway, Hiritano Highway and Magi Highway.“We hope our target for linking PNG through the road sector is realised before PNG celebrates its 50th Independence anniversary,” Mr Wereh said.
“Port Moresby will be linked to Northern and Highlands regions from Lae to, Goroka, Madang, Mt Hagen and Alotau.”He said by 2030, PNG should have a single undivided road network on the mainland of Papua New Guinea and single-road corridor in the island provinces of Manus, New Ireland, East and West New Britain and the Autonomous Region of Bougainville (AROB).“Phase one will start with a road link between Port Moresby and the main urban centres including Lae, Goroka, Madang, Mt Hagen and Mendi.”
Phase one is currently underway, targeting the country’s most important core highways.
Recent notable key achievements under Phase 1 included:-Wau-Bulolo road maintenance from 9-Mile Junction to Wau, K65m;-Improvement and maintenance of Mendi-Tambul road in Southern and Western Highlands provinces (55.53km) Kl72.1m;-Rehabilitation and upgrade of Kundiawa-Gembogl-Bundi highway in Chimbu Province, (20.4km) Kl13.9m;-Upgrade and sealing of the East Cape road in Milne Bay (52km), K96.5m;-Rehabilitation and upgrade of Pangia-Wiru loop road in Southern Highlands (31.14km) K86.0m;-Rehabilitation and upgrade of Henganofi-Nupuru road in Eastern Highlands (34.0km), K85.2M-Construction of 12 bridges on the New Britain Highway-Hiritano Highway rehabilitation and long-term maintenance (125km), K77.56m.Connect PNG Phase 2 (2027-2034) will include improvements and maintenance of a further 300km of provincial and district roads in the 21 provinces.Phase three will see the completion of the project from phases one and two and the start of the development of Gulf-Madang corridor via Chimbu.This will improve links between the major urban, commercial, industrial and transportation centres in the Highlands and Mamose regions, with Port Moresby in the Southern region and connect regional areas with significant economic development potential, especially in the renewal resources sectors of agriculture, fisheries and tourism, to the national land transport network.“In this regard, strategic national and sub-national land linkages are planned for development over the next 20 years under the Government’s Connect PNG Economic Roads Development program (Connect PNG 2020-2040), which will reduce transportation costs and promote economic development at the cost of K20 billion,” Mr Wereh said.The ADB (SHHIP) from Nadzab Airport junction to Kagamuga Airport junction, which is 340km, will be upgraded at the cost of K3bn.The SHHIP program is implemented on three separate sections along the Highlands Highway running through Morobe, EHP, Simbu, Jiwaka and Western Highlands provinces.The first section under the SHHIP: Rehabilitation upgrading and maintenance from Nadzab to Henganofi (210km), K264.1m;The second section under SHHIP: Rehabilitation upgrading and maintenance from Henganofi to Mangiro and Miunde to Kagamuga (218km) K203.26m;The third section under SHHIP: Reconstruction from Mangiro to Miunde in Chimbu (57km) K341.3m; High impact projects under the DoW high impact office saw two major infrastructure investment to Lae and Mt Hagen;Upgrade to Mt Hagen four-lane road from Keltiga to Kagamuga in Western Highlands (13.76km), K306.31m;Completed Lae four-lane of the Highlands Highway section from Lae to 9-Mile junction; and, 9-Mile to Yalu bridge in Morobe Province (9.3 km) K134.84m.

Koura Way had to be cut through new terrain joining the Port Moresby backwater suburb of June Valley and Hanuabada, and also opening up the area for development.
The project, costing the NCDC K80 million, adds to the fast-developing road network for the Nation’s Capital.
However, that has done little to ease the traffic congestion between 7.30am and 8.30am every morning from Monday to Friday.
Koura Way road maintenance underway. 
It was opened in September 2018 by then Works Minister Michael Nali.
Minister Nali at the time said: “The city is moving in the right direction, you have the opening of this K80 million road project, you know the Government has given up to K2 billion to National Capital District Commission for all these roads, stadiums, all hospitals, and the flyover.
“When we built the Poreporena Freeway, critics said it was a waste of money, yet they drive on the freeway,” he said.
Koura Way itself is 4.5km with the bypass to Poreporena Freeway opening at two locations behind the police headquarters and near the Weigh Inn motel.
However, as seen in the pictures taken by Post-Courier, over time the road heading into the Ranuguri tunnel has eroded and a near sinkhole opened up before it was closed, however the road kept dropping.
Now the road is closed with Contractors working on the road.
According to information received the road will be closed for the next few weeks.
Notice to motorists that the road is undergoing repairs.
Some sections of the road is closed for the time being.

BY PEARSON KOLOTHE last village of the Lower Lai constituency in the Wapenamanda Open Electorate in the Enga Province has finally been unlocked and connected to the outside world by road.This is after excavators from the Wapenamanda District Development Authority finally reached Tupokores, a village bordering Kompiam district and Baiyer Lumusa in the Western Highlands Province.
This road will continue into Lumusa and Baiyer and to Mt Hagen in due time.People living in these areas have shouldered coffee bags, garden produce and store goodsfor the past decades but these these struggles will be memories of the past as the road opens them up.This road construction is undertaken by Wapenamanda MP Miki Kaeok who is also the Vice Minister for Works and Highways.
Approximately 80 kilometres of roadworks have already been covered from Mambisanda near Wapenamanda to the last Tupokores village and will continue joining nearby Kompaim and eventually into Baiyer.This road is part of the National government’s Connect PNG road program and is expected to link Wapenamanda to Baiyer and to Madang through the Baiyer Madang Highway.

BY JERRY SEFERoad infrastructure development program (RIDP) for Bulolo District is well underway, says Bulolo MP Sam Basil Jr.He said the infrastructure development program will cover all rural areas that are not linked by road services.
Mr Basil said the Bulolo District Development Authority (DDA) will be working closely with the Morobe Provincial Works to ensure road projects are delivered.Mr Basil was accompanied by road works engineers and provincial works manager Sampson Apai visited Upper Baiyune on Sunday to carry out scoping for two feeder roads for Yamap and Zari that will be upgraded.“We are now starting off our district RIDP with Yamap and Zari roads and will continue to other areas to make sure all our rural areas in our district are connected by road networks,” he said.
“This is one of our major development programs for the district and we will not just sit down and wait for funding to deliver but to start working while taking the full responsibility for the good of our people.”Mr Apai said for provincial and district road development projects, they will work closely with the DDA to ensure all necessary aspects and standards of DoW are fully complied for quality work so that the roads last long for effective service delivery.“Our involvement is to make sure that contracts award for any particular roads in the district are well managed and the funding allocated is equivalent to the work delivered.
“On that note we will also make sure the district is compliant with the Financial Management Act for procurement and guidelines purposes while ensuring quality control is of priority,” Mr Apai said.Meanwhile Mr Basil said it is important for districts to work with construction companies and genuine road works authorities who are financially secure and capable to deliver road services.Not engaging companies that depends on the district funding and leave projects incomplete when funds from the National Government are delayed.The MP said road is crucial to link basic government services to the bulk of the rural population and it is his aim to make sure by 2027 all feeder roads are upgraded and new roads are created in whole of Bulolo.He said this was his promise to Bulolo and will honour his words to deliver the much needed service to meet the demands of his people.

A historical and significant achievement under this medium term development progress of the govenrment is the delivery of the much-anticipated connectivity between the southern and northern parts of the country.Thanks to the government’s key infrastructure flagship program, Connect PNG, the 94km road construction that started in 2016 that connects Gulf, Southern Highlands and Hela, is now open for use.People who live in those rural enclaves can now seek markets with their rural produce through this connected-missing link.
The Aigiru Highway starts in Kikori, links the Okuk Highway and stops in either Lae or Madang.Prime Minister James Marape, who spent his Christmas and New Year on these highway, is grateful and pleased at this milestone achievement.“I thank the Works and Highways Department for connecting the South and the North through the opening up of the Erave Simberingi Road,” Mr Marape said.
“Over 60 per cent of this road link, which is called route 700, is sealed and though 40 per cent is not sealed, it is usable.“The government is committed to funding this road, and we hope to seal the remaining 40 per cent in this medium term,” Minister for Works and Highways Solan Mirisim added.He said the government remains committed to connect the missing links in the country, opening up all landlocked areas in the rural areas, and allow greater accessibility for people to enjoy benefits of government services and businesses.
“The govenrment has allocated a complete funding of K1.6 billion to the Department of Works and Highways, and we will ensure government priority roads are constructed to highest standard,” Mr Mirisim said.The Connect PNG 2020-2040 is a 20-years transport infrastructure development strategy intended to maintain, rehabilitate and construct strategic socio-economic development roads that will support farmers, tourism, schools, and health care centres and expand the benefits nationwide.The other national targeted roads includes, Baiyer to Madang, Telefomin to Tambul, East-West New Britain, and off course, the Trans Islands Highway, connecting Port Moresby to Highlands and Momase regions.

At the signing in Port Moresby, local MP Maino Pano welcomed the Chinese contractor and at the same time applauded the government for its undivided support.“We (Kagua-Erave district) have important projects in the district and on behalf of the people, I want to thank the Government for their support and also the Minister for National Planning Rainbo Paita,” he said.“I would also like to extend our thank you to the other ministers and the Minister for Works and Highways and the Secretary for Works and Highway for their support to make this project a reality,” Mr Pano added.
He also welcomed the contractor to Kagua-Erave district and said the contractor has set bench marks in other districts in terms of road constructions.“The contractor is currently engaged in Finschhafen district, Morobe Province and has set the bench mark of delivering quality work on time,” Mr Pano said.He added that after Tulire – Yalu road upgrading and sealing project, Polopa road will continue with the support of the National Government.
Kagua-Erave chief executive officer Andy Bobola said there were various impact projects for the district and one of those was the signing of the road project.Mr Bobola also thanked the contractor to partner with Kagua-Evare DDA to deliver much needed impact project.

			K88 million Halimbu to Koroba road works launched

Prime Minister James Marape says least-developed districts like Koroba-Kopiago in Hela province are for the first time seeing development.He said this in Koroba last Friday when launching the sealing of the last section of the Highlands Highway from Halimbu Junction to Koroba at a cost of K88.89 million.A 10 per cent upfront payment of K8.889 million was made to the contractor on Friday to start work as well as K8 million for the contractor of another road from Maria to Kopiago.
This comes under the Marape government’s flagship “Connect PNG Program” with 30 per cent counterpart funding from Hela provincial government – despite it being a national project.“Koroba-Kopiagio is one of the least developed districts in PNG like Telefomin, Tari-Pori, Karimui, Goilala, Pomio, Kandrian-Gloucester, Nuku, Middle Ramu, Jimi, Samarai-Murua and Esa’ala,” Mr Marape told thousands of people at Koroba.“Over the last two years, we have given over K2 billion worth of contracts for infrastructure development throughout the country, with those in Hela including the roads from Komo to Halimbu, Ambua to Tari, and from Ambua to Mendi.
“Along the Highlands Highway, major roadworks have been completed, including two-lane bridges all the way from Lae to Mt Hagen.“The Works Minister and Works Secretary recently launched construction of the road from Vanimo to Aitape, and from Aitape to Wewak.“These are just a few of the many road projects being developed with this K2 billion.
“Over the next three years, we will be issuing another K5 billion worth of road projects throughout PNG, and Koroba is also included in this program.“The road from Halimbu Junction to Koroba is being built at a cost of K88 million, Maria to Kopiago K90 million, as well as various others.“I want this last section of the Highlands Highway from Halimbu to Koroba to be completed over the next five years so that you are no longer a ‘forgotten place’.“I am here to show you today that you are not forgotten by the Government of PNG.”Mr Marape thanked the Hela Provincial Government and Governor Philip Undialu for the 30 per cent counterpart funding.“This type of counterpart funding has never been done before for a national highway,” he said.“The road from Halimbu to Koroba is a national highway, however, I thank the Hela Provincial Government for bearing 30 per cent of the costs when it did not have to.”Mr Marape said this money will be reimbursed through the National Government funding a provincial road in Hela.He said what Hela had done was a good example for other provincial governments in the country to follow.

The K10 million second phase of the Waigani Drive rehabilitation works is on schedule and should be completed soon says NCD Governor Powes Parkop.While the public is furious over the traffic congestion along the area on peak periods, he said the road rehabilitation is necessary especially after more than 25 years of usage.“There is no hold up the work is almost completed.
The entire rehabilitation will go all the way to the National Research Institute roundabout.Because that road has been there for more than 25 years so it is really worn out but the base is okay. It’s to reseal it.We want to rehabilitate it so that it gives us another 30 to 40 years,” Mr Parkop said.
He added that while the government is prioritising the development of road connections in rural PNG, roads in the city are equally important and the National Capital District has been doing well in this regard.The first phase of the Waigani Drive rehabilitation works started in February where drainage system was upgraded, the road was resealed and the bus stop moved further up the road.The second phase which commenced in August, 2022 reaches from the North Waigani traffic light intersection all the way to Ensisi roundabout where the road has been graded ready for resealing.
As a result traffic along the area to and from Gerehu and the Tokarara road has been heavy over the last few months.Global Construction is the company engaged for this project and will work on both lanes.

BY JEFFREY ELAPAThe Government’s vision to achieve 100 per cent road connectivity in PNG by 2040 has received a funding boost of K300 million, Works and Highways Minister Solan Mirisim (pictured) said.Mr Mirisim when giving a financing and progress update on the current connect PNG program of the Government said the additional funding will maintain good progress on ongoing works under the Connect PNG Economic Land Transport Infrastructure Development Program, popularly referred to as the “Connect PNG Program”.
He said the additional funding will also kick start upgrading works on six more new critical sections of the national road network on the Manus, East-West Highway, the New Britain Highway (East & West New Britain), the Magi Highway (Central & Milne Bay), the Ramu Highway (Madang & Morobe) and the Coastal Highway (East &West Sepik).He said the government has also fully retired the K600 million for capital works program as appropriated in the 2022 National Budget.This includes K300 million for provincial and district roads under a Sub-national Roads Development Program, separate from the Connect PNG Program.
“To date, all of the 2022 funding have been released in full as intended according in the 2022 Annual Work Plan,” he said.Mr Mirisim expressed his satisfaction on the overall performance of the Connect PNG Program, attributing the programs exceptional progress, to the government’s strong leadership and commitment, and the huge support from donors and development partners, with ongoing guaranteed funding support.He said transport infrastructure plays an important role in providing connectivity for our urban and rural communities, businesses and industries.
“Good roads play a crucial role in encouraging socio-economic development and progress of the country, as land transport accounts for over 80 per cent of national freight and passenger traffic volume,” he said.However he said the existing road network in the country has steadily fallen into a state of disrepair due to lack of maintenance over the last 20 years.The poor road network condition has become a brake on our economic development.Access to markets and service delivery have become much more difficult, travel time and vehicle operating costs for road users, are much higher than normal,” he said.However to address the challenge of recovering the condition of the road network and improve road connectivity for our citizens and businesses, the government approved in 2020, the 20-years Connect PNG Economic Road Infrastructure Development Program 2020-2040 that will cost a total of K20 billion.“The Connect PNG Programs long-term goal is to obtain ‘100 per cent Road Connectivity for PNG by 2040’. In the medium-term, the goal is to achieve a road link between the National Capital District with Morobe, Madang and the seven Highlands provinces, before the country’s 50th Independence anniversary,” he said.Mr Mirisim said: “The achievement of this road linkage by the September 2025 target date, will symbolise our national development, cohesion and unity over the past 50 years of independence, as well as achieve a significant development milestone, by connecting our two cities for the first time.This target will also enable our people on the mainland to travel affordably, to celebrate PNG’s Golden Jubilee in Port Moresby or their home province, as they wish.“In 2021, the National Parliament passed the Connect PNG (Implementation and Funding Arrangements) Act 2021.“The purpose of this Act is to legislate a guaranteed minimum funding for the Connect PNG Program, equivalent to 6.5 per cent of the annual budget, each year.Based on Treasury’s medium-term budget
Forecast for 2023-2027, the minimum funding translates to around Kl.4 billion annually, for the Programmes Phase 1 period up to 2027, inclusive.“The Connect PNG Program is Prime Minister Marape’s ‘flagship’ development program.“I am therefore thankful for the support and the importance the Prime Minister has accorded to the program since Cabinet approved it in 2020,” he said.Mr Mirisim said the program aims to rehabilitate and reconstruct 16,500 kilometres of economic roads and 1000 metres of bridges and other drainage structures that have deteriorated over time due to lack of regular maintenance.He said the program is also constructing Missing Link Roads (new economic road links) totalling around 4200 kilometres.Currently the Missing Link section of the Trans National Highway between Aseki, Morobe province and Epo, Gulf province is under construction.The completion of this road section will establish the strategic connection between Port Moresby and Lae City.The Connect PNG Program is being implemented in three Phases. Phase 1 is from 2020-2027 at K7.98 billion.

SECOND term Wabag MP and Health Minister Dr Lino Tom says all villages in Wabag district, Enga Province must be connected by road in order to have access to basic government services and associated developments.The Wabag District Development Authority has embarked on connecting the rural population which include neighbouring districts it shares borders with who have been living in the dark since the past like the Maramuni LLG.In his maiden term in office, Dr Tom connected the once neglected and isolated Maramuni LLG by road.
Meanwhile, work is being done to connect Angoram in East Sepik through the proposed Enga-Sepik Highway road project.The Kiwi-Anditale road project is a reliable road network connecting Wabag to the Upper Ambum area in the Kompiam-Ambum Electorate as more people live along this area.The Sopas-Yokonda road project is another impact road project that will connect the people of Upper Lai area in Wabag district with the people of the Surinki and Lagaip area in the Lagaip Open Electorate towards the west of Enga.
Another ongoing road project is the Birip-Aiyel Valley road project that has connected the Middle Lai area that starts in the Birip government station near the Wapenamanda/ Wabag electoral border and stretches into Aiyel Valley and Tsak Valley of the Wapenamanda Electorate.Recently, the Wabag DDA presented a new PC 210 excavator so the Yalu road can be further built linking last villages along the Wapenamanda-Wabag border stretching into areas of Tsak Valley in Wapenamanda.This new excavator will be used to further build the road through the Yalu mountain to make road access possible for more than 3000 people living there in isolation since time immemorial.
The Yalu-Aiyel Valley road will open up coffee markets as coffee is predominantly grown in these areas.The Yalu road in the Aiyel Valley was once the ancestral route taken by ancestors who traded foods and participated in other tribal obligations with the people of Tsak Valley in the Wapenamanda.The Yalu road once completed will help the people take a much shorter route to Tsak Valley and Wabag respectively.Most people in Wabag have been living without a road network since time immemorial pretending to live decent lives foolishly disguised by the provincial capital status of Wabag.In fact, Wabag district was 90 per cent inaccessible by road but this statistic has greatly improved since 2017 when Dr Tom won the Wabag Open Seat.Currently, approximately 35 per cent of the electorate is inaccessible by road which the Wabag District Development Authority will prioritise to make all of the electorate accessible by road by 2027.

			Marape: Government commited to connect PNG road program

Prime Minister James Marape says his government is living up to their connect PNG Program after officiating two road projects in Enga Province.He said this last Friday at remote Maramuni in Enga, bordering East Sepik, when opening the K15 million 57km Maramuni Road linking Maramuni to Wabag, and launching the Enga-Sepik Highway which will link Maramuni to Karawari in East Sepik.The Maramuni Road crosses some of the most-rugged and difficult terrain in the country and was done at minimal costs by the Wabag District Development Authority and Enga Provincial Government.
The area is known to be rich in gold and agriculture and has huge untapped potential in tourism, however, there was no road and people used to walk to Wabag – which took several days – until now.“We are trying to connect all rural areas right throughout the country,” Mr Marape said.“In this year’s budget, we have allocations for 163 roads throughout the country.”
He said Maramuni is one of these “missing links” which included Tabubil-Telefomin linking Western to West Sepik, Karimui-Kundiawa in Chimbu, Finschhafen-Lae in Morobe and many others.“We are trying to connect all these missing links,” he said.“Over the last three years, we have spent K15 million on the Maramuni Road – which is not a lot of money.
“To break down mountains along the Maramuni Road would require K50 to K60 million.“I want to thank the leaders of Enga, especially Governor Sir Peter Ipatas, and Dr Lino Tom for making it possible.”Mr Marape also commended the construction team for being honest and hardworking to complete the road and avoiding unnecessary expensive contractors.“I want to thank Dr Lino Tom, Governor Sir Peter, the team on the ground, including local boys who handled the machines, for putting smiles on the faces of both young and old at Maramuni,” he said.

BY ESTHER KAUGAWhen you think of development within a community, what comes up in your head immediately?If you answered with “excellent road conditions” then we are on the same page here.
Roads pave the way for the community or an area to access all the basic services that the urban centres get to experience on a daily basis. These services include electricity, health and education.A good road system will literally pave way for countless possibilities to come into any community. It will make or break the community, hence it is an important factor for development within the community.Enoch Rapenda, 54, of the Keltika tribe in Tengtenga village in the Hagen Central District of Mt Hagen, has had the dream of transforming his small community and bringing development for a while until he chose to action it early this year.
“One of the needs that I saw in my community was for proper road constructions as my people found it a daily struggle to transport their goods and even their sick to and from the outside centres”, he said.Enoch is married to Alice and they have three children, two boys and a girl.Both are Adventists and are involved in mission outreaches, planting churches and sponsoring Adventist missionaries to remote parts of the country to share God’s love.
He is also the founder of the Joy Bells Singing Ministry that travels throughout the province and even overseas to sing about God’s love and the proceeds that are taken from their album sales goes towards supporting their ministry.“When I saw that no one, no leader in the community or even outside was interested in fixing my community’s problem, I took matters into my own hands and tried to solve it, hence this road project started. If you wait for a miracle to happen, it won’t unless you make the first move and it will gradually take shape and happen in your life”, he said.The road project initially started early this year and has been ongoing and they are hopeful to complete it by the end of the year.The road will help in benefiting approximately well over 2,000 people who live in and around the Tengtenga village and other surrounding communities of the three council wards the Kintka, Jiga Pargimp and Jiga Mukmana.The road network runs through two mountains and also involves a bridge.According to Enoch, the road project was going to cost them about K3.7 million but because they used their own manpower and equipment, the cost has greatly decreased.“The estimated amount for both mountains was K1.5 million each and the bridge was going to cost roughly about K700, 000 to complete.“This estimates were given by a civil engineer who assessed the project.“So basically this road project was going to cost us about K3.7 million.“But we cut all the cost down by providing the manpower ourselves and my vehicles were used to transport the heavy stones and also I donated my cement mixer to the project so that helped us in cutting a lot of costs and so in the end, the first mountain cost about K26,769. 20 to complete and the second mountain, which is yet to be completed, have cost us so far K14,843. 50.“The bridge will roughly cost about K15, 000 so we have collected K3,000 already and are set to go. So far we have spent K41,612. 70 for this road project”, he said.The funds were taken from the community in an ingenious way that Rapenda came up with, seeing as it was a community project, the community had to pitch in financially.“If I were to ask them to give a large amount every time, they would soon give up because money is not easy to come by these days so what I asked for them was that they contribute K1 per head every Sunday for the road project and so they did and as we collected, the amount gradually increased until we would get about K500 to K800 every Sunday”, he said.Financial help began pouring once the project was underway but Rapenda refused to receive any funds from political sources other than Paias Wingti, the Governor of WHP and Hagen Open Member William Duma.“A lot of intending candidates offered to pay for the completion of the road but I refused to accept their funds because I want no political involvement in this road project as we all know that politics is a very unstable field to be mixed up in and the last thing that I want is my community to get all messed up in the messy game of politics where there are strings attached,” he said.With the bad road conditions, it has affected the community’s health services with the Tengtenga Health Centre’s residential doctor in charge, Dr Anis Mik reflecting on the struggle that the medical staff face on a daily basis in terms of transporting the badly injured and mothers who are nearing their delivery trimesters.“Lives have been lost along the road as the youths struggle to load the badly injured or the mothers in labour on a wheelbarrow and run down the hill in order to get to the waiting ambulance by the bridge which is about a few kilometres away.“We have been facing this problem since the health centre was established in 1984,” he said.Dr Mik said that since the health centre’s establishment 28 years ago, there has been a number of casualties and six deaths as a result of the bad road conditions.“Ever since I started working here, I have seen mothers rushed to the ambulance during labour and sick people rushed to the hospital in a similar manner.“It is a painful thing to watch and not being able to do anything as we do not have all the medical supplies on hand to perform complicated surgeries so we have to send them to the Mt Hagen General Hospital and six people have lost their lives.“This road project that Mr Rapenda has embarked on will contribute to saving lives in this community. In order for health services to be functioning well, it needs a proper road network to transport patients and the necessary medical equipment needed to perform complicated surgeries.“So on behalf of the health services in the community, I am thankful that Mr Rapenda is doing this for his community”, he said.The other aspect that is affected due to the road condition is viable economic activities.While the community’s land is fertile, they cannot plant crops because there is no proper road to ensure easy transportation of garden food and so as a result most of the villagers plant crops like leafy vegetables (choko leaves and pumpkin tips among others) and tobacco so they can be able to carry it to the road to sell.“We have good soil but we cannot plant the crops that we would like to plant and sell like cabbages, pineapples and potatoes.“That is why most of us plant light crops that we can easily carry to sell at the market to at least buy our daily necessary needs”, said Nongnui Dopinu, a local farmer.“What Mr Rapenda has done is something that we truly appreciate.“We waited for our political leaders to do something and they did not and so now one of our own has taken the initiative and we are grateful and we praise God for using him to meet our community’s need”, she added.The community have shown their appreciation towards the Rapendas ever since they started the road initiative early this year.“Mothers will come to me with tears in their eyes and leave garden food by my feet and just leave without a word.“As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words and I know that they might have thought of their hard experiences with the road and so they are showing their appreciation.“God alone knows their struggles and I am willing to ease their burden in the only way I can and that is to ensure that they have a good road network”, he said.The road work was done by all the community members.The youths did all the ground work while the mothers divided themselves into two groups, the first group cooked lunch for everyone on the job site while the second group of mothers helped the boys in collecting stones from the nearby river.“The road foundation was dug about half a metre deep and was filled with stones from the river and the manpower was provided by all the members from the three council wards.The mothers prepared lunch and helped out as well and our community elites helped in funding for the project.It was basically a community initiative.“In order to start something, you have to take the first step and action it before you can ask for support and so I did that with this road project.“Since it was my idea, I set aside other projects and focused on building the first few metres and then I contacted the elites of the community and informed them on my plans and they began pitching in financially once they saw physical evidence of the work taking place”, he said.Along with the health and economic aspect affected, there is currently no electricity within the community and surrounding villages.Mr Rapenda said that for there to be proper setting up of power poles, there has to be proper road access.Furthermore the Rapendas are planning on creating a tourism site along their area and advertise it so that tourists can come and enjoy nature and buy local produce that the village mothers will sell.Mr Rapenda stressed further on the fact that development within communities can happen but there has to be someone who must raise their hands up and lead their people to action.His motivation is meeting his peoples’ needs physically prior to their spiritual needs and leaving a legacy within the community so that the future generation can benefit from it.“My aim is to transform my community spiritually but you will not be successful in that if you do not take care of their physical needs first.“So I studied my community and found out that road was what they needed so this project began.“This is basically what Jesus did when He was on earth.“He met the peoples’ needs physically before feeding them spiritually and they were satisfied.“I am merely following the footsteps of the great teacher.”

The Malahang to China Town road defects will be rectified following concerns raised by citizens over the quality of work that was done.The appearance of cracks in the concrete slabs is a concern for the people living along the recently constructed road.Lae MP John Rosso, during a conference last year, said he shared the same concern and will look into the matter and ensure he raises it with the works division who is the supervising agency of the construction company that built the road.“I share that same concern. I will do an inspection of that particular road,” he said.“I’ve heard a lot of comments on it. So I’m going to go and inspect that and if it is then works department is the supervising agency and I’ll bring that to the attention of the department of works to have an inspection and see what they can do to rectify it with the contractor.”This has now been taken into consideration by the contractor this year which they will now look to repair the road with adjustments done to also be implemented on the new Second Seven to Bumayong road.“Those querying Malahang-China Town road cracks, after careful investigations were done, the cracks will be rectified by the contractor on their own cost,” Mr Rosso said.“There are some adjustments being done on the pavement design which will be implemented on the current Bumayong road work as well.“Due to high rainfall in Lae, the contractor under the close supervision of the Department of Works and Highways is building stone pitch drainage systems for the entire section of the road to manage the heavy rainfall.”

THE upgrading of roads will continue this year in Lae city with road works starting on Erica Street.
Erica Street is used by a number of businesses operating in the area.
More roads in the city are set to be upgraded this year as Lae City Authority continues to prioritise suburban streets and major arterial roads in the city.
Lae MP John Rosso said the road project will continue this year.
“We are continuing this program from the previous years through the partnership with the IRC (Internal Revenue Commission) and the National Government to collect and use 20% of GST revenue returns to Morobe on upgrading our suburban roads in the city.
“So far we have completed Eriku streets right up to Taun Street, 2-Mile to 4-Mile, Kamkumung and Tent Siti in progress.

EAST New Britain is in for further economic development in the province.
This follows plans afoot for a major ground breaking ceremony later this week for the construction of a four-lane highway from Tokua to Kokopo City.
The ground breaking ceremony for the two phase multi- million-kina project will mark the first which is the construction of a 17km stretch of road from Tokua to Kokopo.
The second phase will be from Kokopo to Rabaul.
According to a statement released by the East New Britain Governor Michael Marum, Prime Minister James Marape and Minister for Works and Highway Solan Misirin will officiate at the event.
Governor Marum: “Their visit will also coincide with the launch of the Kokopo district five-year development plan and eight other major projects for the district.
“These projects include the Duke of York ringroad, Kibil Health Centre rehabilitation work, Kokopo City Hall, and the 4km Kabaleo road.”
He said Mr Marape will be there on the Governor’s invitation to see other project areas also in the province.
The Prime Minister will visit the Rabaul town electrification projects and the solar farm.
The Tokua to Kokopo City road project is one of three major road developments which Mr Marape is committed.
The road project is under the PNG Connect program.
The other two projects include the South Coast Road in Pomio launched in December last year by Pomio MP Elias Kapavore and the New Britain Highway.
Mr Marape will be accompanied by other senior Government Ministers including Planning Minister Rainbo Paita and Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey.

			Colonial road track in Hela undergoes rehabilitation work

A famous track used by the colonial administrators to travel between Koroba and Lake Kopiago in the Hela Province has been rehabilitated, thanks to the local MP Mr William Bando who spent no time to open up that missing link.
The Koroba-Kopiago district development authority, under the leadership of their local MP Mr William Bando, wasted no time to construct the Teria-Yagabi to Kakoma road, a colonial track that was used as a short cut to travel between Koroba and Kopaigo.
The Teria-Yaguabi to Kakoma road is among 8 other rundown roads that are undergoing major rehabilitation and maintenance, a major development initiative undertaken by the local MP within the first one year in office. 
Since being elected into office, Mr Bando prioritised law and order and road network in his district. 
He said opening up road accessibility and opening up missing links and rundown road network in the province can change mindsets and the perception of people and there he wasted no time to rehabilitate all the major road network in the district that have been neglected by past leaderships.
According to the locals, the Teria-Yaguabi –Kakoma road project took just less than 4 months and covered almost 7 kilometres, and it is about to reach the main Highlands Highway which will be connecting the frontiers of Tumbutu valley in the North of Koroba to Kopiago Basin excessing 32 council wards of more than 50, 000 population which used to be known as ‘back-page’ due to lack of services delivery.
“Opening up missing link road and rehabilitation of the old colonial roads that have deteriorated overtime is indeed a welcome initiative of the MP.
“We appreciate the MPs tireless construction team on the ground for the tremendous work done in a speedy limit, providing some of the best road construction we have never seen before. 
We also acknowledge the Mr Bando for his leadership, irrespective of the political difference, he is equally distributing services to everyone and that is the kind of leadership we want to see, a matured, smart and innovative leadership,” a local said on the Koroba-Kopaigo social media forum.

			Road pushing towards Tagali river

THE new Mount Bosavi road in the Nipa-Kutubu district of the Southern Highlands Province is pushing further into the thick jungles towards the mighty Tagali River.
Last week, the contractor and locals organised a small feast, a traditional practice to allow nature to release the land and the environment that has never being disturbed by humans, and to allow machines to cut through the forest.
If such special traditional offerings are not done then it is anticipated that they would encounter problems and bad luck in their efforts to build a road. 
After the feast, killing pigs and sprinkling pig’s blood, the machines are now cutting into the virgin forest toward the Tagali River.
The Tagali River is the source of the Kikori River.
The road, when completed, will serve more than 20,000 people locked away in that part of the country, located between Kutubu, Komo in Hela, Gulf and Middle Fly district in Western Province.
The Bosavi area is one of the world heritage sites, home to some of the unique plants and animals.
People from the area usually walk for more than four days through thick jungles to arrive at Waro in the Lower Foi of Lake Kutubu or fly by MAF to Mt Hagen.
Nipa-Kutubu MP Dr Billy Joseph made an initial funding of K5 million of the Nipa-Kutubu District Development Authority funds to buy bulldozers, excavators, trucks to start the process by cutting through thick virgin forest.
The 48-kilometre road, is part of the Government’s Connect PNG program but the most difficult part of the road is building an 800-metre at one of the narrow part over the Tagali River.

Obura-Wonenara MP John Boito has fulfilled his commitment to have an excavator to start working from the back of the district towards the front.He said he had made this commitment onboard a helicopter on his campaign run to Andakombi in Marawaka in the 2022 National General Elections with ward member Michael Kudea, who requested for an excavator, if he is elected. “I told him over Vailala mountain that today you sit with me in this helicopter, but if I win tomorrow, you will get an excavator,” Mr Boito said.“I could not forget this commitment because we made it in the air, not on the ground.”The excavator and a dump truck were driven to the Asakumdi community in ward eight of the Kome local level government area in Mynyamya district, Morobe Province, where road works will begin from towards Matawaka to wherever it meets with two more excavators working from Aiyura going backwards.Mr Boito said he would work with his colleague Solen Moifa to have this part of the country connected and continue to Sindeni to link up with the Trans-Highway to Gulf and Central Province now under construction.He also made it clear to the people that the Eastern Highlands provincial government, under the chairmanship of Simon Sia, is helping him to move the changes taking place in the district.Moks Takaje, on behalf of the Asakumdi community, reflected on the launching of the Obura-Wonenara district five-year development plan at the Aiyura Valley near Kainantu a month ago, which focuses on road infrastructure, including sending an excavator to the back of Marawaka to start work from there.“This has now been fulfilled and we now commit ourselves to work together,” Mr Takaje said.Robert Rodney, on behalf of the Marawaka community, said most of the people in this part of the country have no idea of what an excavator is.“We just celebrated our 48th independence anniversary last weekend and all those years, we have not had an excavator coming this way, even a dump truck for that matter,” Mr Rodney said.Mr Boito honoured this commitment one year and a month after the declaration of his election as the MP for Obura-Wonenara in the 2022 National General Elections and three days after the Papua New Guinea’s 48th independence celebrations nationwide on September 16, 2023. The people from the rolling mountains gathered at Asakumdi to welcome Mynyamya MP Solen Moifa and Eastern Highlands Governor Simon Sia who joined Mr Boito for the presentation of the excavator.Mr Sia assured them that more machines will be coming to speed up the work in connecting these isolated communities tucked away behind the rolling mountains and encouraged the young people to take their education seriously, adding that the government is committed to supporting human resource development program.Mr Moifa stressed the importance of road access to allow services into their areas, and appealed to his people to take ownership of the heavy equipment machines. including the ones working on the Mynyamya district road.He stressed on their cooperation in terms of letting their land for the development to take place and looking after the machineries and the workers.Mr Boito also stressed on the local cooperation as well.“We will celebrate when we launch the opening of the road,” Mr Boito said.“Now is not the time.”

BY MEROLYN TENENGA people are few kilometres away to enter the Sepik provinces via land transport as the construction phase of the huge Wuwai River log bridge had just been completed.Minister for Health and Wabag MP Dr Lino Tom said K10 million was in budget for the construction of the Enga-Sepik Highway because the Enga District Development Authority’s constructors have been engaged to do the road work.
He said it would be a milstone achievement for the country to connect provinces with only K10 million, for the fact that other road-links connecting provinces in the country cost more than a K100 million.“The log bridge over the Suwi River is complete now, while three new machines on the Pasalagus side (Wakem Area) are doing wet crossing over to Nelyaku to join one that was on that side.“Pilot tract is now at Nelyaku. We will head to Tapend Council Ward this month and then onwards to Poreak. It won’t go up to Poreak but swing right and cross lower Maramuni River and climb the last mountain range onto the Sepik plains,” Dr Lino said.
He said the road-link was currently going through the most difficult and dangerous terrains of lower Maramuni, and when it reaches Poreak- a village in lower Maramuni, it would cross over again over lower Maramuni river.“Finally, we will then ascend up a mid-size mountain (nothing compared to the ones we have already built through), and the Sepik plains will be in view from the summit.Upper Karawari, Penale village and others are at the base of this small mountain range where we would then descend onto the Sepik plains and head for Elem and then onto Biwat,”he said.
Dr Lino said that access was the most important enabler for all of basic government services to flow as it provides an equal platform for development.“We as a district are therefore prioritizing this so we leave no one behind in our pursuit of development.“When complete, this road will be one of the most important impact projects to be ever undertaken by the Enga province where, we have to connect with an emerging Economic giant, the East Sepik Province,” Dr Lino said.

The Wabag District Development Authority is embarking on linking Wabag and Laiagam districts in Enga province by road.The road works resumed last week starting at Sopas and will pass through Yokonda before reaching Kanak in Lagaip district.Wabag MP and Health Minister Dr Lino Tom said that the road will be an alternate link to Laiagam through the fertile plateau of Yokonda in Sirunki area.
Dr ToM said he was confident that before the end of this year, road construction is expected to reach Laiagam.“A very important commodity road that will see fresh high altitude vegetables reach our new market,” he said.He said the two major pillar policies of the Wabag district is empowering the people through agriculture-based small and medium enterprise (SME) activities and universal quality education. He said both policies will be achieved through this important road link as the bulk of the rural population lives in this part of the electorate.
Dr Tom acknowledged the local Sakarowan clan of the Malipin tribe for taking ownership of this vital project and allowing work to continue.

BY GREGORY WESLEY
UPNG journalism studentProlonged road construc­tions along Port Moresby’s Waigani Drive has affected the lives of city residents but pretty soon it will cost people’s jobs and livelihoods.Since the construction commenced mid 2022, the Mobil Service Station operating next to the traffic lights, has been struggling to make sales and the management is at the verge of laying-off staff just to keep the business going.
According to Jack Tepu, managing director of Cobbie Car Rentals Limited, the company operating the Mobil Service Station, if the constructions do not conclude soon, several staff will have to be laid off.“If this continues we just cannot afford, in fact, we will go belly up and we are almost there, now we are struggling to keep up with all our cost.Real costs together with workers’ salaries and if we are not making that much sales, how do we stay alive? The road construction is killing us,’’ Mr Tepu said.
He said during the Christmas and New Year when the construction ceased operations their sales went up, and declined again when construction resumed this month.“They got families , they got children at school, they got to put bread and butter on the table, they live in the city and we do not want to leave them on the streets,” Mr Tepu said when considering laying off staff.Attempts to get comments from Global Constructions Limited was unsuccessful.
However, a senior worker at the construction site when asked on the delay in construction said the wet weather has significantly affected the work especially when asphalt was scheduled to be applied to the road.“Attempts to put asphalt on the road was disrupted by the weather, but asphalt is now expected to applied to the road on Sunday and that depends on the weather condition,” the worker who wished to remain anonymous said.While the construction impacts business houses, it was also noted that the lack of proper signs and directions along the road has confused many drivers.The general public in Port Moresby has been vocal on the impacts of traffic queues in recent weeks.Attempts to get comments from the National Capital District Commission were also unsuccessful.

BY JEFFREY ELAPAFinally the upgrade and sealing contract for the 28 kilometres Halimbu-Koroba station road in the Hela Province was signed at the Government House yesterday.The road sealing work to cost the State more than K88 million was signed between Governor General Sir Bob Dadae and contractor China Civil Engineering Construction Company represented by Wang Lifu (managing director) and Lu Ting (business manager).
The signing was witnessed by the Secretary for the Department of Works and Highways David Wereh who signed on behalf of the department in the presence of CEO of National Procurement Commission Simon Bole and Hela leader Damien Arabagali.The road work is schedule to start in December after the Authority to Pre-commit Committee gives the undertaking that the funding is available for commencement of the project and it is expected to be completed towards the end of 2024.The National Executive Council has approved and requisitioned the Department of Treasury to appropriate K40 million per year over the next two years to complete the road.
The Hela Provincial Government has also committed to co-fund the road project and will pay 30 per cent of the total cost.Under the NEC decision, the road will also be funded through the tax credit scheme.The road project is part of the National Government’s Connect PNG project and is also part of the Umbrella Benefit Sharing Agreement of 2009 in Kokopo for the government to fund the construction of the road from Kikori to Moro to Tari and to Koroba and terminate in Kopiago on the border of West Sepik.
The road is part of the Highlands Highway that starts in Lae and ends in Koroba but is yet to have a road built from Koroba to Kopiago.The road when it reaches Kopiago will connect with Kiunga, Tabubil and Telefomin road which is under construction.China Civil Engineering and Construction Company PNG Limited managing director Mr Wang said his company is already established in Hela after constructing the Tari airport and will deliver the project on time and schedule.He said as a partner delivering projects in Hela for the past five years, he thanked the National Government, the Hela Provincial Government and the Department of Works for recognising his company to deliver an important road for the people of Hela.

The K61.8 million, four-lane road from 9-Mile to Laloki Bridge along the Hiritano Highway is finally open after months of construction.This world class road, as described by NCD Governor Powes Parkop, now gives easy access to the businesses in the area to the city.At the launching yesterday, he thanked Hebou Construction Limited for a job well done, noting that this road will be durable one for will last for many years to come.
“This road will stay for a longer period. In the city now we have plenty of vehicles and we have to build roads that are durable.“This road will look after you for the next 20 to 30 years into the future,” he said.There are plans in place for the 9-Mile to be transformed into a mini township and already a market has been built and launched last week while a police station is under construction and plans for a clinic are in progress.
Mr Parkop extended special thanks to former city manager Bernard Kipit for his contribution and support towards this project and many others. He shared his vision for development in the National Capital District, noting that change is a must as the country moves forward.

BY NELSON JOETHE election is not having any impact on the improvement programs currently under way in Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province.Construction work is continuing on those roads that were started recently.
On the first four-lane road along the Elizabeth Street from the junction of the Highlands Highway to the Goroka Bowling Club, the contractor China Wi is filling up and compacting the road base while the drain work is still continuing.This will be followed by application of bitumen and then spreading of fine gravel.Operator Jimmy Bire of Nokondi Works, from whom the contractor has hired some earth moving machinery to work on the project, said there is no funding issue and the contractor is determined to complete the work within the three-month schedule.
He said bad weather has hindered their progress from time to time.At Dog Street, along the Bihute road bypassing the Goroka Provincial Hospital, the top soil is cleared and the contractor Columbus is working on the drains and culverts.One of the employees working there said they will dig some more and then fill up with road base and compact it.
At the time the work on the roads began, the PNG Fire Service Goroka branch stepped in and marked out the positions of the fire hydrants which the contractor should consider when working on thew road.
Eastern Highlands Works unit is supervising both projects.Meanwhile, work on stonewalling and flower beds at the Rotary Park in West Goroka is continuing as well.This is part of the beautification program that the Goroka District Development Authority, has embarked on to engage youths in suburbs around town.Foothpaths at the back of the Yanepa Building and the Peace Park under this program are completed.

BY PAUL BUNGTABUWORK on the Malona to Mapuna Road right through to the new hydropower project at Toto River in the new Mamusi Yana local level government in East New Britain Province is nearing completion.Pomio MP Elias Kapavore and members of district development authority were recently at the construction site to inspect the road project.
The new road will also link Mapuna, Peling and Kaitoto to the Palmalmal township.The project is funded by the district development authority.Mr Kapavore said the road will connect the Palmalmal headquarters to the new Mamusi Yana LLG chamber, which will also be constructed in Mapuna once the road is fully graded.
He said road connectivity still remains a big challenge in most of the rural communities in East New Britain and this includes most inland villages in Pomio.“I thank AG Energy Ltd for a great job in tearing the mountains down and connecting our people,” Mr Kapavore said.He said AG Energy Ltd was engaged to construct the proposed hydropower project.
‘’The Malona Road will lead directly to the proposed hydropower station at River Toto,’’ he said.Mr Kapavore said some of the best coffee is also cultivated in the mountains of Mamusi and the road is a relief to many farmers.“The road will boost the economy in these rural parts of the district,” he said.The Malona Road will be commissioned later this month.The people of Mapuna, Kaitoto and Peling will now have access to a new road.

BY FRANCO NEBAS and JONATHAN JOEConstruction work on the Erap – Dinangat road is midway through to reaching the first village of Kabwum district with the completion of nine kilometre.Yus local level government council civil work manager Erap Menanga said during a visit by media personals to the project site last Thursday.
He said a total of K1.8 million was allocated by the Kabwum District Development Authority (DDA) for the maintenance of Erap – Rabisap section of the road (Nawaeb) and the new cut Rabisap-Dinangat road.He said the local MP Patrick Basa’s aim was to see that the four LLGs in the district get connected with the district and provincial headquarters by road.He said the civil work team has been established in respective LLGs of Yus, Deyamos, Selepet and Komba with allocation of funds to build and upgrade roads in their respective LLGs.
“Kabwum is one of the districts with rough terrains, rivers and many mountains making it difficult for people to have access to government services.The only mode of transportation is by air but it is costly for ordinary villagers to afford to uplift their cash crops and fresh food vegetables to Lae.“It also affect little SME operators especially trade stores owners to uplift their store good supplies into to their respective LLGs,” he said.
“When Mr Basa was elected into office, one of his visions was to have the LLGs connected by road to the district and provincial headquarter to ease the burdens for his people,” said Mr Menanga.He said the current road project will not only serve the people of Kabwum but also Nawaeb district especially in Wain-Erap LLG.He said the Erap–Rabisap road had been neglected over the years without maintenance by Nawaeb DDA.“We had to pass through villages in Nawaeb district into Kabwum, therefore we had to maintain the deteriorating section of their road between Erap and Rabisap that was left neglected over the years.”He said the road serves a total population of nine thousands from the two districts, Nawaeb and Kabwum.“This road is one of the economic corridors to the people of Nawaeb and Kabwum in terms of agriculture,” he said.He said the project has reached over 9km at the cost of K1.8m.“It will take a month to reach the boarder but we need funding. We want counterpart funding from the Provincial Government, Governor Ginson Saonu and Nawaeb DDA under local MP Kennedy Wenge.“Only with one excavator we have been able to reach more than 9km from Rabisap to where we are right now.“We have 20km more to go to Dinanga and we need funding to help us build bridges.Yus LLG President Kitowe Mumusio commended MP Basa for the initiative taken to connect Kabwem by road.He said road is one of the main challenges that people of Kabwum face for many years.“We have cash crops, fresh food vegetables but it is costly by air and I believe the construction of this new road will contribute to the economy of Nawaeb and Kabwum districts.“I want this road to be Kabwum Highway so people will be happy.“On behalf of the people I thanked MP Basa for his vision to connect Kabwum by road,” he said.

BY MAXINE KAMUSOk Tedi Mining Limited has signed a K50 million project agreement with China Railway Construction Engineering Group Limited for phase one of the upgrading and sealing of the Tabubil to Kiunga Highway.OK Tedi Mining Limited (OTML) deputy chief executive officer and general manager community and operations support Kedi Ilimbit said the project has three phases which will cost around K150 million and phase one which cost K50 million will take about 18 months to complete.
He said the road is funded under the government’s Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme (ITCS) program with phase one to start in February which will see the upgrading and sealing of the highway starting at Kilometre-3 near Kiunga town.He added that the 135-kilometre highway provides a vital link for the people of North-Fly and having it upgraded and sealed will significantly help people, farmers and small-to-medium enterprises.“For the construction company China Railway Construction Engineering Group Limited they were among nine other contractors that offered to carry out the projects.
“However, the other companies did not meet the requirements and proposed an amount over the budget of the project,” he said.Mr Ilimbit added that the contract was given to China Railway because they met the standards and requirements.He added that he will make sure they will complete the project in the given time frame and allocated budget as it is of importance and a priority.

BY JANET KARIBusiness investments in Lae will continue to grow with progress on the new Nadzab Airport and the four-lane Okuk Highway.The Nadzab Airport Redevelopment and the four lane road are two projects which once completed will render Lae and Morobe as a whole, more attractive for businesses, tourism and other exciting investments.
Lae Chamber of Commerce Inc (LCCI) president John Byrne made these statements following reports of the airport’s 40 per cent completion as well as positive reports on the progress of the four-lane road and other various infrastructure developments in the city’s vicinity.Mr Byrne said already there are key investors in the city reviewing plans and the new infrastructure developments are shaping up to make Lae an even more sought after business location.“Lae already has several key investors reviewing plans and the new airport and the highway only makes Lae’s offering of the largest port operation, manufacturing base and center-point to both the Highlands and Islands more attractive for businesses, tourism and other investments,” Mr Byrne said.
“A new airport coupled with a newly refurbished highway results in easier access and better conditions into PNG’s second largest city, Lae.COVID-19 has had some impact but the contractors are working diligently with a high level of PNG workforce to complete this project.“When completed it will not only be a world class airport but have facilities and better living conditions around it for our people.”
He said the developments are eagerly awaited by the Lae and Morobe community in both the public and private sectors.Lae City Authority chief executive officer Neil Ellery also made similar statements saying that there is a massive amount of investment coming into the city indicating business confidence.Mr Ellery made this statement during the reopening of one of Puma Energy service stations in Lae worth more than US$1 million.He said the amount of investments coming into Lae shows business confidence in the leadership and developments currently going on.“We have investment from Cocoa Cola, Goodman Fielders, Angau Redevelopment and Nadzab airport and others, the future look very positive for Lae,” Mr Ellery said.Mr Byrne said through the Lae-Cairns Sister City program, LCCI together with Lae City Authority (LCA) continue to work toward a direct flight from Cairns to Lae.He said when the airport is completed it will assist national and expatriates who travel to and fro, including seasonal workers program.“We welcome investors to visit Lae and see what we have to offer.“When we get the green light on agricultural programs like GrowPNG and resource programs like Wafi-Golpu this provides a platform for employment, education and improved living conditions,” Mr Byrne said.Recent business developments includes K1 million warehouse for the Coco Cola Amatalil, a huge development project for GFI at 11- Mile, a facelift of an existing Puma Energy Service Station worth more than US$1 million, opening of Ela Motors new dealership and a new model in PNG, Orica’s new explosive manufacturing plant and others.Other vital infrastructures includes the Nadzab Redevelopment (more than K500m), the multi-million kina Angau Memorial General Hospital Redevelopment, four-lane road with recent announcements of road continuity (Yalu-Nadzab), he completed K14m road from Unitech-Telikom junction, and the recent road construction of the Malahang-China Town road (K14m) and Bumbu Bridge-Kamkumung road (K3) and others.

By PHOEBE GWANGILOAGGRIEVED residents from Gerehu in Port Moresby have prevented a construction company from working on the construction of a four-lane road.At around 9am, residents of Tarumana Avenue confronted a (named) construction company to refrain from further bulldozing the fruit trees and food crops planted alongside their residences.
“We want the National Capital District to get our views and explain to us so that we can accept the development,” said spokesman Joseph Paiembo.“This is a residential area; we have been experiencing water-shortage since June because the water-supply pipes have been subject to the change,” Mr Paiembo said.He said the extended four-lane road was less than 10 metres away from their houses that saw fruit trees and food crops uprooted.
“We’ve lived here for more than 20 years; Mango and banana we planted outside our houses have all been destroyed.”He added that even a power pole had just been erected closer to his house, to replace the previous one that was in the way for development.Mr Paiembo said it was unrealistic to have a four-lane road built in residential areas.
“While we appreciate the development around here, there is no public relation consultation,” Mr Paiembo said.The upset residents are requesting proper dialogue to establish common understanding between them and the NCDC.NCD Governor Powes Parkop said he would get engineers to visit the aggrieved residents to hear them out.“I will get our engineers to visit them tomorrow and listen to these grievances.“Road construction, however, always stick to defined road easement. 10 metres from road to premises too is standard footpath and distance between road and premises to cater for power, water and sewerage easements,” said Governor Parkop.He said in an earlier statement that the project costed about K42 million.“This construction is to widen the existing two-lane Gerehu Drive, Tarumana Avenue and the Modiki Drive, into four-lane roads and will be built to full construction standards.”

By MICHAEL KOMACHIMBU’S businessman and development advocate Peter Iggy has called on the government to maintain the existing road network in the province instead of building new ones.He said the Simbu Provincial Government and the six districts should concentrate on rehabilitating the existing trunk, feeder, and access roads in the rural areas.
He said building new roads, while the existing road infrastructures are left to deteriorate, is an unrealistic and blind decision.“It would be appropriate to maintain the existing road networks which he dubbed as “less expensive instead of financing new road projects which are not used by many rural people,” he said.Mr. Iggy told the Post-Courier in Kundiawa funds expended on new road infrastructures in several parts of the province should be saved for other developmental projects.
“In most cases, new feeder roads were built by the Kundiawa government and the six DDAs.“The MPs involved in approving the release of funds to contractors were making decisions without little consideration for other worthwhile projects like education and health services,” he said.He said the only exception is the Gumine-Karimui trunk road project which is still in the making since 1992.
“This project would have been completed only if the contractors were doing honest work.“Millions of kina were poured into the Gumine-Karimui road project over the past 19 years by the National Government.”He said Karimui people are still “crying for a serviceable road which will connect their remote area to the outside world but successive contractors were not doing a fine job: they were only interested in the money and not service”.Mr. Iggy has called on the government to probe circumstances surrounding the project and engage reputable road construction firms to take up the job for better results.

MICHAEL KOMAAttempts are now being made to resume work on road between Gembogl (Chimbu) and Kwongi in the Eastern Highlands Province.About half of the 65km Kuraglmba-Kwongi road was completed with an undisclosed amount by former Kundiawa-Gembogl MP Chief Wagi Merimba in 1989.
Successive MPs from both Kundiawa-Gembogl and Daulo did not make any attempt to complete the road until last week when funds and equipment were mobilised to get the road through.Kundiawa-Gembogl District Development Authority has acquired an excavator, a bulldozer and two dump trucks for the road project.The machines have began work at a place called Kongmagl cutting through thick rainforest toward Pobumer village, 43km east of Mt Wilhelm.
Kongmagl is the spot where the first road construction work stopped in 1992.A foreman said construction work would be completed by June 2022 “if all goes well”.The DDA has released K500,000 to meet urgent costs while an additional K2.5m would be poured into the project.
Local road contractor Kaiaworks was awarded to work on the road.Daulo MP Pogio Ghate and the DDA had committed an undisclosed amount of funds towards the project saying the infrastructure would improve the lives of about 40,000 people in the area.Some of the villages set to benefit from the road project are Yombai, Garaumauglo, Kwongi one and two, Miruma including the remote Sireni Coffee Plantation.Locals at the project site said despite the incomplete road they walked to Asaro to get on PMVs into Goroka.The Kuraglmba-Kwongi bush track was used by the Asaro, Gembogl and Bundi people to reach Goroka since the late 1930s, according to government chronicles.Gembogl businessman Mathias Merimba reportedly used the Kuraglmba-Kwongi-Asaro track to ferry cargo during the early stages of his business.

BY JANET KARIThe 30km road from Nasing-Napohondong in Finschhafen district, Morobe Province will be the first road in the district to undergo sealing.Commencement of the road sealing was officiated by Minister for National Planning and Monitoring and local MP Rainbo Paita and Transport Minister William Samb early this week.
The road project is under the district plan to connect the district through roads and to link them to the Lae-Finschhafen Highway.Mr Paita said with the district services improvement programs (DSIP) grants and other additional funding the road project has commenced.“We are going phase-by-phase and going into manageable portions based on funding. We will seal the first 5km then go on to the next phase until we complete the project,” Mr Paita said.
“The reason to seal the roads is to ensure that we do not spend so much on upgrading roads. It is easier for us to seal and move to the next stage.”The work will involve 600 meters of sealing per day. The second phase of the road sealing will be the Mape Bridge Bonga road.Mr Samb said such a project was important not only for development but also to the community as it can improve their mindsets.
“With the sealing, we can have buses operating or we can have small vehicles like a taxi in the district.“The district is fortunate to have a young, dynamic and visionary leader who is working to ensure that such projects are implemented in the communities for the people. Our problem has always been roads and to start with a road like this is commendable,” Mr Samb said. “The challenge is to ensure that funds allocated for this project are managed well and utilised for its purpose and ensure the project is completed.”

BY GORETHY KENNETHThe Highlands Highway, starting in Kutubu in the Southern Highlands, meanders its way through six Highlands provinces before it reaches the coast in Lae, Morobe Province.An arterial bypass at Watarais near Ramu heads to Madang’s Binnen port.
Stretching thousands of kilometres through lowlands, up spectacular mountain passes, down into misty fog covered valleys and fertile farmlands; it is often referred to as the lifeline of the country.Through its riverine-like twists and turns flow goods and services and millions of passengers each year.Papua New Guinea’s export coffee and tea begin their journey here.
For the life of it, having an all-weather road link is one thing, maintaining such a critical infrastructure is another thing.Considering the terrain, the weather and the tribal issues along the highway, fixing the road in a timely requires a tough no nonsense approach.In Chimbu last week, I met the China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd.
They are working on the 57 kilometres Chimbu road project.This is just one part of the K3 billion Highlands Highway Rehabilitation project that should be complete by December 31 this year.China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd executives told me at their Ganige camp that the Rehabilitation Investment Contract consisting of the rehabilitation of the 57 km of the Chimbu section of the Highlands Highway between Mangiro Bridge and Miunde Bridge has had very challenging setbacks not only because of Covid-19 national pandemic but also the geological issues and local social problems involved.The project is now over 40 per cent completed amid several challenges faced but China Harbour has assured that even facing the Covid-19 pandemic hiccups, the geological issues nightmare and the local social issues that come with it, they would still complete the project on time.While this has happened in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the company, CHEC has progressed the roads to capacity since the signing ceremony amidst these major challenges.“In a normal situation, once we were awarded and started executing the contract, timing is always not an issue.“SSSSEven we have had challenges here, we will try our best to get this project completed on time,” said Project Manager Jim Wang.“Covid-19 pandemic is a very serious problem for the project, during pandemic period, it affected all of us, the measures issued from international and government affected our operation for limiting some incoming cargos and site implementations, but we are slowly getting back to normal and real time operation.“Nowadays because of the vaccine we are positive and optimistic that everything for this project is becoming better and recovered.“Another issue affecting the project implementation is the thorny and poor geological condition along Highlands Highway in Simbu section.“Persistent landslides and collapses, which beyond both the Employer and Contractor’s control, are affecting the progress until now.“Despite these serious challenges we are facing, we are still putting a positive and confident attitude to fulfill and complete the project.“Since the commencement date of this project, we have provided more than five hundred jobs and engaged hundreds of local employees as engineers, supervisors, drivers, operators, secretary, cleaner and normal skilled and unskilled Labors during the project implementation.”To support the Chimbu provincial epidemic prevention and control, China Harbour has donated more than 4000 masks to the Department of Health and Police.They also did many donations to surrounding schools and communities, which is part of the company’s aim in strengthening its relationship with the people in the province. Local communities, residents, and member spoke highly of the company.China Harbour has been in PNG for more than 10 years and always is ready to work and construction for Papua New Guinea’s developing.Wang said: “We know why we are here. We came here for work and construction to help developing the highlands highway to give Highland people a proper lifeline.“That’s why we are confident tocomplete this project on time with good quality and quantity.”This is part of the Sustainable Highlands Highway Investment Program (SHHIP), otherwise referred to as the investment program, which aims to rehabilitate, upgrade and maintain the Highlands Highway through physical investment.Additionally, aligned with provisions and policy framework of National Transport Strategy (NTS), the investment program provides capacity development for the broader transport sector.It promotes national cooperation and integration and widens access to social and economic opportunities via improved land transport infrastructure in PNG through the nation’s most important road.2. Impact and Outcome: The expected impact of the program is aligned with national strategies1, 2, 3 where:
(i) opportunity for equality and prosperity in rural areas is increased;
(ii) well integrated; safe; socially, financially and environmentally sustainable transport systems is attained; and
(iii) access to health, education and other services and living standard of the people of PNG is improved.The expected outcome is efficient and safe increased movement of people, goods and services between the Highlands region and the markets.Women’s church groups paraded escorting the guests through the pathway formed by students – red carpet like, as the students threw flowers on the path.

BY SAMPSON BONAIA total of K66 million has been allocated by Australian Government to rehabilitate Lae to Bulolo Highway in Morobe Province.Prime Minister James Marape, who accompanied Deputy Prime Minister and Bulolo MP Sam Basil to launch the rehabilitation project last Friday, thanked Australia for the funding support.
“I thank Australian Government for your funding support of this important road infrastructure development to connect Lae with the resource rich district of Bulolo,” Mr Marape said.“The government is looking at giving funding support back to the resource rich districts to who are contributing to the economic development of the country.“Wau and Bulolo have contributed immensely to the development of the country through all the major companies like Hidden Valley mine, PNG Forest Products, Zenag Chicken Farm, the alluvial miners and other cash crop farmers of coffee and cocoa.”
Mr Basil also expressed his gratitude to the Australian Government for funding the rehabilitation work from Nine-Mile Junction to Bulolo and said the rehabilitation of the highway will soon link up Bulolo (Morobe) with Central Province.“I acknowledge the vision and foresight of PM Marape and Works Minister Michael Nali for ensuring that the important national road rehabilitation project gets off the ground this year,” he said.“The government had allocated K5 million to K10 million for the construction of the Wau Biaru and Sim Bapi road to connect the remote Waria local level government.”
The closed Garaina Tea plantation will also be re-opened to start tea production once the road is connected to Waria LLG.“The district have funded the sealing of the Wau and Bulolo town roads through the District Support Improvement Program and the royalties from Hidden Valley mine.”Other roads from Wau to Nemnem Koviak and Nami were also upgraded for the vehicles to transport the people and their produce to the markets in Wau and Lae.Mr Basil said Kaindi and Bitoi roads will also be rehabilitated by the district to improve the road network in the district. He also announced another K50,000 towards the the Wau town water supply project.Australian High Commissioner Jon Philp, who was part of the official delegation, said the Australia Government is committed to assisting the government of PNG in infrastructure developments.The funding for the rehabilitation of the Lae to Bulolo highway is funded under the Australia Partnership Program with PNG to ensure the country is connected with proper roads,” Mr Philp said.“The funding had been released to the national government through the Works Department and the rehabilitation work should commence once all the formalities had been finalised with the contractor.”Works Minister Michael Nali and Works Secretary David Wereh who accompanied the delegation to Wau thanked the Australian Government.“We will commence the rehabilitation work in three months time once all the formalities with the contractor Classic Engineering has been finalised to enable them to start working on the important road infrastructure from Lae to Bulolo,” Mr Nali said.“I also would like to make it clear that any highway linking the provinces are regarded as the national highways and are funded by the national government while the roads within the districts comes under the responsibility of the provincial governments and district development authority.”

A nationally-owned road construction company Kaiaworks has made peace with the landowners and spirits before breaking new forest areas to push through a new road from Vanapa in Kairuku Hiri district.Kaiworks Ltd managing director Godfrid Umba and his workers killed two pigs for a mumu with the landowners at Kania on Saturday to have with the community before the construction work begins this week.Member for Goilala and Minister for Transport William Samb also contributed a pig towards the gathering at Kania in upper Vanapa river on Saturday.
Mr Samb said the Goilala district development authority (DDA) has purchased two excavators, one bulldozer and one vehicle which will be managed by Kaiaworks to start pushing the new Dubey Highway to Woitape.He said the Marape government had made a commitment of K5 million towards the road construction for 2021.“Sam Basil went to Ononge and committed K5 million for road. Because of COVID-19 and issues to do with procurement the district bought road construction equipment and told Kaiaworks to come and manage while the contact is being finalised.”
“Kaiaworks is a PNG company who had done the initial grading and now with the specific funding of K5 million for 2021, Kaiaworks will do the work.”
Kaiaworks MD Mr Umba said the company is breaking new grounds and in line with Papua New Guinea custom, we have to talk with the landowners and spirits to be at peace before we break into new territory.
“We are not here to do ground breaking, we are here to make new friends in a new territory, to know each other and meet ward members and community leaders to clear new bushes,” Mr Umba said.

BY JEFFREY ELAPAThe remote Telefomin District in the West Sepik Province will be opened to the outside world for the first time when the Tabubil-Telefomin road finally reaches the district headquarters by mid next year.This assurance was given to the people by the Secretary for the Department of Works David Wereh and the contractor building the 80km road.
Telefomin is one of the most remote districts in the country that is not connected by road, but it’s only reachable by air from Tabubil, Kiunga, Mt Hagen or from provincial capital,Vanimo.The district is divided into three local level government areas of Telefomin, Oksapmin, Namea and Yapsie, and has a total population of more than 60,000 people.The district headquarter is at Telefomin, a town that was built during World War II to use the airfield by the United States Air Force against the advancing Japanese army.
Oksapmin shares border with Lake Kopiago in Hela Province, Namea LLG shares its border with Vanimo-Green, and Nuku district and Yapsie LLG share the international borders with West Papua in Indonesia.All of these LLGs are disconnected from each other and the district headquarters at Telefomin. The only way in is by small plane, or by walking through thick jungle and rugged mountain terrains.Generally, there is minimal economic activity in the district but there are opportunities for economic activities like vegetable farming in the Oksapmin valley, harvest of black wood in the Yapsie LLG and alluvial mining along the Frieda River and Blackwara communities in the Telefomin LLG.
But market accessibility for garden and farm produce will remain a big challenge for these isolated, landlocked communities.Accessibility to goods and services is very expensive and painstaking, but the people and the public servants have lived this way for decades.The major source of income for the people is agriculture in Oksapmin and human resources. About one-third of the workforce at the Ok Tedi mine come from the area, with seven of them occupying top management positions.Generally, the living standard of the people is far ahead of other communities in PNG that have road accessibility as the people scarified to build permanent houses by chartering planes at a cost of about K7000-K10,000 to fly in their building materials from Mt Hagen, Vanimo or Tabubil.Seeing the need of his people, local Member of Parliament Solan Mirisim, who was elected to office in 2012, has been searching for opportunities to allow his people access to the outside world, and initiated the Tabubil-Telefomin road project. Mr Mirisim was determined. He approached the then government of Peter O’Neill to help fund the road as his commitment to join his government as an independent MP in 2012.The road project took a while but after being re-elected in 2017, the government finalised the funding for the first phase of the road construction at a cost of K45 million through the Ok Tedi mine tax credit scheme.Many engineers, including a survey of K10 million and a feasibility study costing K200 million, engaged by PNG Sustainable Development Program (PNGSDP) back in the 1980s found that it was not possible to build a road through the area because of the tough and difficult mountain terrains.Former managing director and CEO of Ok Tedi mine Peter Graham also thought it was impossible to build a road based on the feasibility study and survey reports conducted earlier.However, Ipwenz Construction Limited, a local contractor based in Tari and Mendi, decided to use its experience in building the Hiri-Lai road, which has similar conditions to the road connecting Hela-Mendi, to have a go at it.Mr Mirisim said his desire was to give hope to his people from Olsobip in the North Fly district, who have been isolated for decades.The road construction started on May 7, 2018, from Ok Menga near Tabubil, and took three years for the contractor to cut through thick mountain jungles, following bush tracks.Department of Works project engineer Kennedy Namo said they built the road through one of the most geographically difficult environments in the country through pre-con survey without any feasibility study reports.“Feasibility study is a waste of money as I see. Firstly, we do a pre-con survey where we look at the environment, and find the route through the use of local knowledge, and also by studying the environment,” Mr Namo said.“Then we design and build. After pre-con surveying, we will come back and do what is called ‘as built survey’, where they will put the alignment and grade so it is accessible for traffic.”The people of Telefomin and Olsobip and other communities in the area have been walking through dark, thick and dense forest canopy, mud and big tree trunks and roots that have never been exposed to sunlight for decades, to reach Tabubil. It was a relief at last, at the end of November last year, when the construction team completed the first 33km of the 86km of road.Young children born to locals in Tabubil who have never seen their homeland are now visiting their villages and uniting with the relatives.Those deceased in Tabubil can now be laid to rest in their villages, while mine workers are now able to spend weekends in the villages with PMVs resuming passenger runs to the area, moving people and cargoes.The second phase of the project will start with the signing of more than K109 million between the Department of National Planning, Departments of Works and the contractor last week.It consists of K34 million for the construction of the Olsobip road and K75 million for the Telefomin road that will start at the foot of the Hindenburg Wall to Telefomin.The construction of the Olsobip road was launched by the Governor for Western Toboi Awi Yoto, and the MP for North Fly James Donald.Both projects will start concurrently this week.More than 80 per cent of the road is in the Western Province, while only 20 per cent is in Telefomin district in West Sepik Province, and is supervised by the Department of Works and the Ok Tedi Mining Limited.During the launching, Mr Yoto commended Mr Mirisim for providing the leadership to start the road project which will serve both his landlocked people in Olsobip and others places in the North Fly district.“I will never be here if it was not for the visionary leadership of Mr Mirisim. I commend the minister for providing the leadership to give hope to our people,” he said.“Many engineers said no road could be built to Olsobip and Telefomin but I commend Ipwenz Constructions, the local contractor that has proven the foreign engineers wrong and has delivered one of the best roads in the country by cutting through geographically difficult mountain terrain using local knowledge and experience.”Mr Mirisim said he had a dream to build a road for his people because of the hardships they continue to face while trying to access goods and services. He said the road should have been built many years ago as Ok Tedi mine operated for almost 35 years, but past leaders failed to provide the leadership and lacked vision and determination to seek assistance from Ok Tedi.He said seeing the need of his min people (from both North Fly and Telefomin) he provided the leadership to seek help from Ok Tedi mine and theGovernment.“I had a dream for this road but if it was not me, who else would build this road for us,” Mr Misirim said.
“No one would have done it. Ok Tedi was here for 35 years but no-one provided leadership. My dream is now a reality and I thank Ok Tedi and the Government for helping to fulfill my dream. I also give credit to the Member for North Fly James Donald, the Governor for Western Toboi Awi Yoto and the people for their support. It is not easy to bring services like this road, so I want all your support to allow this road to reach Olsobip and Telefomin together before 2022.”Managing director of Ipwenz, Moses Palipe said his company will deliver the Olsobip road and the Telefomin road before the election in 2022. “I’m committed to the people of Olsobip and Telefomin,” Palipe said. “My father was a missionary and served the Min people of Olsobip and Oksapmin, so I will follow his footsteps and deliver the road by 2022 and continue into Oksapmin and connect Lake Kopiago and the Highlands Highway in Hela.”Secretary for Work David Wereh said the road is one of the connect PNG plan roads, reaching the unreached areas.National Planning Secretary Koney Samuel said this is the first time the government is committed to funding the connect PNG and as chairman of Tax Credit they would continue to fund the project.
