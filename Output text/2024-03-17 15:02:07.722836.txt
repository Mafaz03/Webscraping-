The Edevu hydro power station construction is on schedule, with all work to be completed by the end of September, 2023.
The Edevu power project, opened in April this year, will supply 54 megawatts into the Port Moresby grid with 2x turbines each producing 27 megawatts.
The current peak loan demand in Port Moresby grid is 132 megawatts.
PNG Power chairman McRonald Nale said Edevu’s bigger sized generating units with higher inertia will add stability to the Port Moresby grid.
“With Edevu, Port Moresby grid will have an improved ability to withstand electrical shocks and disturbances, thereby reducing network blackouts. 
Having high inertia machines from Edevu will significantly reduce total system outages caused by network cascading effects. 
Edevu hydro power brings clean, fuel free and low-cost power to supply increasing demand in the Port Moresby grid,” Mr Nale said.
PPL estimates about 40 to 50 megawatts are produced and utilised by large industries off grid due to reliability issues.
“With low cost power from Edevu hydro, this will improve network regulation and improved attention to our customers through a range of initiatives, including Amnesty Program and Feeder Team Management, we believe the industries not on the PPL grid will reconnect,” Mr Nale said.
PNG Hydro Development Ltd managing director Allan Guo said the total towers of the main transmission lines to be built from Edevu to the Moitaka is 104.
“Work on erecting and stringing of towers is completed from tower 1- tower 39. From tower 39 — 89, erection of towers completed without stringing. 
This week, our contractors will be working on towers 90 — 95, that is doing the foundation work and so forth,” Mr Guo said.
By the end of September, PNG Power will officially do the technical commissioning for the Edevu Hydro Power Station, and will run on full operation for three days, before final tests are done and the official commissioning takes place.

It was a first of its kind in the history of the Telefomin people to access a new road.This new road from Tabubil, Western province connecting the first village, Urapmin in Telefomin district of West Sepik province was launched last Friday.The Urapmin villagers including nearby villages in the district and North Fly people, Tabubil and Kiunga turned out in numbers to witness the launching ceremony.Urapmin ward president Siniki Babeloki said it is a new beginning for them.“We have over 700 people in this village and we are so happy.“We walk for three days and nights to reach Tabubil.“We carry store goods, iron sheets, teaching materials and other things from Tabubil and walk back through the cold, foggy and rugged mountainous terrain to reach Telefomin.“Some of our people have died along this bush tracks.” he said.Mr Babeloki said seeing the machinery and trucks in the village is a joyous experience as the construction of the road means they can now reach Tabubil by truck and return home the same day.Telefomin district administrator Joshua Himina said the lack of road has been a major hindrance for delivery of services.However, this road will enable them to see more changes in the district.“New roads linking nearby villages will be done, health centres, schools and other services as well. All of these services are captured in our five -year development plan,” he said.It took six years since 2018 to construct road connecting Western and West Sepik provinces.Other eight kilometres of road construction from Urapmin village to Telefomin station will continue this month and further road construction will continue to Oksapmin rural LLG starting this year.The engineers from the contractor Ipwenz Construction Limited (IPZ), other sub- contractors with support from Ok Tedi Mine through the tax credit scheme under the Connect PNG program have helped established the road.Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, Minister for Works and Highways and Telefomin MP Solan Mirisim, Labour Minister and Rai Coast MP Kessy Sawang, Hela Governor Philip Undialu, OTML managing director Kedi Ilimbit and other dignitaries witnessed the event last Friday.

A THIRTY-six kilometre Ring Road Project in the Rigo North LLG of Rigo District in Central Province has been completed by Koia Investment Company Limited.
The Ring Road will now serve 20 council wards of North Rigo LLG who have been suffering from lack of better road access for the last 27 years. The Ring Road project was funded by the Central Provincial Government under the works program.
Present during the completion of the road last Sunday (27th August) were ), respective community leaders of Rigo North owner of the construction company Biari Ubuna, Acting Police Station Commander of Kwikila police station, Sergeant Bobby Ogara and a representative from the Rigo district development authority.
A community Leader Murray Gini thanked the constructor and the Central provincial government for providing the needed service to the 17, 000 plus population of Rigo North.
“The 20 council wards in the hinterland of Rigo District gratefully accolade praise to the management of KICL for the construction of Sivitatana – Wiga road connection,” Gini said.
“The road has been cut off for public use for about 27 years ago, which in other words can be put as political negligence for the last 5 terms by the previous governments.
“The Prime Minister James Marape declared the Rigo Inland Ring Road as Yagabo Highway when he was invited at Boregaina Village in late 2020 and he had announced K27 million for the road project.
In proceed to that announcement, this portion of the road was not accounted for and this has led our people to uncertainty of the effectiveness of government commitments.
“The people of Rigo North wish to give special thanks and accord to KICL, our sincere appreciation for the great achievement in bringing the road home to us.”
Biari thanked the leaders and people of Rigo North for working together with the constructor and successfully completed the project.
“The constructor is not here to make money but to deliver the needed service to the people of Rigo North.
Even though the scope of the road project ends at Dilikomana village, yet we have continued further for about 8 kilometres to Matanatou Sub Health Centre to fully connect the Ring Road. 
Biari further acknowledged and thanked the Central provincial government for making the funding available to complete the Ring Road project.

A Member of Parliament has called on the Department of Works to carry out an independent assessment of the progress of the Mendi-Nipa highway to verify a social media report by the contractor.
The Member for Nipa-Kutubu Dr Billy Joseph who returned from his electorate has called on the Secretary for Works and the department to carry out an independent assessment (or an audit) on the progress on the highway and to further verify a social media report circulated on the social media.
He said the contract for the maintenance and sealing work on the 58 kilometres road from Mendi (Kiburu turnoff) to Nipa in the Southern Highlands was launched in June 2021.
Dr Joseph said so far not much has been done and no sealing work was carried out by the contractor.
“I travelled on the same road last week and never saw any sealing at all. The rehabilitative work and sealing is supposed to start from Kiburu junction and end at Nipa Secondary School. A total of 58 kilometres.
“My request to the Secretary for Works and Highways to provide an independent assessment of this public social media information or misinformation has not been provided.
“From 2021 until now, there is no sealing and I am concerned.”
He said the poor people should not be cheated for the greed of money, when they deserve a good road.
Dr Joseph said the contracts and the State agencies must not compromise and deny the rights of the people to a good road network.
He understands that about K90 million of the K221 million (40 percent) funding had been released to the contract (excluding the counterpart funding from the provincial government) but zero sealing has been done on the Nipa-Kutubu side of the highway, except some pavement surface preparation including line drainage is going on from Megi Hill to Lai Bridge and to Wolumesa, a length of just 3-4km.
He said with only 18 months remaining for the completion of the project, no progress has been made on the Nipa-Kutubu side of the highway.
“I also believe it should not happen at the expense of our people, especially the people of Nipa Kutubu.”

Projects roll on as Belt and Road Initiative reaches milestone - Post Courier

China’s Belt and Road Initiative has gained momentum since its commencement 10 years ago in 2013.
Initially it had a regional focus but rapidly expanded beyond central Asia towards the Middle East, Africa, South America, Eastern Europe and the Indo Pacific regions, making it the biggest such program since the Marshall Plan after World War II.
Logically, there was a sharp increase in the number of projects, total investments committed and executed, and the number of countries joining as partners. 
The current number of countries and organizations stand at over 150.
China stressed that the BRI was a new model for partnership, trade and integration that was free from hegemonic pressures and conditions. Later the principles of multilateralism, environment and sustainability were embedded in the BRI.
The West, fearing China’s rapid influence through the BRI, came up with competing initiatives such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (G7), the Global Gateway (EU), the Quality Infrastructure Investment Program (Japan), and others, but their ability to rival the BRI in scale is yet to be established.
As PNG joined these 150 other countries and organizations in Beijing this month to review their involvements in the BRI, the Post-Courier takes a brief look at three projects that have been rolled out in PNG under the auspices of the BRI.
The PNG national power grid, which includes a 132kV transmission and substations for Mt Hagen, Mendi, Tari, represents the first collaborative energy infrastructure endeavor between PNG and China under the Belt and Road Initiative.
This project closely aligns with PNG’s national energy strategy, which aims to increase electricity accessibility from the current 15% to 70% by 2030 and ultimately transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
The project is funded by the China Exim Bank and executed by the contractor TBEA Co., Ltd.
The project owner is PNG Power, the project scope consists of the construction of four new 132kV substations (Mt. Hagen, Pauanda, Mendi, and Tari) and a 180-kilometer 132kV transmission line connecting these substations.
Upon completion, it significantly increased the power grid coverage, effectively alleviated energy shortages, and greatly improved grid stability and reliability in the Highlands region.
The project directly benefits residents of the three Highlands provinces (Western Highlands Province, Southern Highlands Province and Hela Province) and provides power to adjacent mining projects, including gold and copper mines.
Consequently, it will efficiently stimulate economic growth in those regions connected by the power grid. 
This initiative can also meet the electricity demands of millions of households and residents, thus improving the quality of life for local communities.
Before 2015, due to the complex geographical environment and insufficient transportation infrastructure, internet access remained relatively expensive in PNG, with only about 12 percent of PNG residents connected to the internet.
There was no backbone network in PNG. The backbone communication network between islands was mainly low-bandwidth and high-cost transmission network such as satellite and microwave. The bandwidth was limited.
New services such as high-speed mobile Internet could not be launched. 
With the development of the local economy, the existed bandwidth could not meet the market requirements.
The PNG National Submarine Cable Network Project (NSCNP) was implemented by PNG DataCo Ltd, a wholesale subsidiary of Kumul Telikom Holdings and a State-owned commercial entity.
This project was one of the high priority projects included in the Framework Agreement on Development Cooperation between China and PNG signed on July 8, 2016. 
The project was financed by EXIM Bank and was completed in June 2020.
This project was a 5457km submarine fiber cable network project connecting 14 major cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang and Lae. 
At the same time, 14 submarine cable landing sites were built in 14 cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang, and Lae, to install submarine cable terminal equipment and network access equipment. 
Two data centers were also built in Port Moresby and Madang, used for supporting the operation of submarine cable services.
Firstly, the project has improved the bandwidth, reliability and stability of PNG’s domestic network.
It helped reduce the internet pricing by introducing competition mechanism;Secondly, the project connects PNG to China through Indonesia. 
The submarine cable has become an important international network channel for the South Pacific island countries;
Thirdly, the project drives the digital economy to help the country’s socio-economic progress and development.
Early in 2000, Fujian Province of China and Eastern Highlands Province of PNG signed a sister province agreement and listed Juncao and upland rice technology as the aiding technology to Eastern Highlands Province by Fujian Province. 
This project was carried out by the team of Prof. Lin Zhanxi from Fujian University of Agriculture and Forestry (FUAF). This project is now in its fourth phase.
In November 2018, during President Xi’s visit to PNG, leaders of the two countries witnessed the signing of the project, the first phase of which started in August 2019 and ended in August 2022. 
In February 2022, the two countries signed the second phase of the project, which will be implemented over a three-year period from September 2022 to August 2025.
The project has overcome the difficulties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, and has overfulfilled the tasks of the project in the fields of training, demonstration, production and extension.
In total, 27 technical training courses have been held, and a total of 2,921 people have been trained; Juncao mushroom, Juncao animal husbandry, and upland rice planting have been promoted to 17 districts in nine provinces, with a total of more than 10,000 farmers and 40,000 people benefiting from the project; and set the world record for highest output of pennisetum giganteum (Juncao grass), which was 8.53 tons per hectare.
Eastern Highlands Province has listed the Juncao and upland rice industries as the second and third major agricultural industries to be developed after the coffee industry.
The project has benefited many farmers in PNG and improved the agricultural skills level of the farmers. 
It became a model of Belt and Road Initiative cooperation between China and PNG, and played a very important role in deepening the development cooperation between the two countries and the sister-province relationship between Fujian and Eastern Highlands provinces.
The project team has provided local farmers with 1,226,700 Juncao mushroom tubes, and more than 1,725 farmers have participated in the cultivating Juncao mushroom.
The farmers mainly produce oyster mushroom and sell the harvested fresh mushroom to supermarkets, local market and supermarkets in Port Moresby.
Zaka Abori, a woman mushroom farmer, started growing mushroom in February 2020 with the help of Chinese experts and selling them through supermarkets, Facebook and social media.
The profit of growing mushroom are 20-30 times higher than her original cabbage cultivation, and the expansion of her earnings has allowed her to independently set up a tube production workshop, and her Juncao mushroom business is booming.
Farmers have planted more than 130 hectares of Juncao grass, and 1798 households have raised chickens, pigs, sheep, cows and other livestock using Juncao grass, significantly reducing their costs. 
In 7 districts including Goroka, Lufa, Hengenofi, Unggai Bena, Daulo and Kainantu, the project has promoted upland rice cultivation over 1215 hectares, and has supported more than 20 large upland rice producers and cooperatives, and promoted 7604 growers, which has brought great economic benefits to the local community.
The implementation of the project has promoted the development of Juncao, livestock and upland rice industries in PNG through technical training and demonstration, and opened up a new way for increasing employment and farmers’ income, as well as environmental protection, coping with climate change and sustainable development in PNG.

The K117 million four-lane road from 9 Mile to Pacific Adventist University was finally launched yesterday and will open doors for economic growth and connectivity between the people of Central province to the National Capital District.
Prime Minister James Marape and NCD Governor Powes Parkop, along with other members of parliament officially cut the ribbon yesterday afternoon after three years of construction declaring the road open.
Mr Marape said roads in the nation’s capital and all across the country allow for the growth of economy especially for small subsistence farmers who depend on proper road access to take their produce to markets. He urged locals and residents to fully utilise the full potential of this road.
“Roads carries the economy and not the other way around. Road and enabling infrastructures carries the economy and today under the flagship program of the Connect PNG program we are punching roads to places that have never seen roads before and not just the nation’s capital,” stated Mr Marape.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop also highlighted that the road offers an economic corridor for the people of Central province into the city thus connecting the farmers to the market and the city to the educational hub that lies within the 9 mile to 14 mile area.
“This road holds great significance for our city and for our country. It serves a vital artery connecting the commercial part of our city to what I say the educational hub of our city.
“As we witness the completion of this infrastructure project we affirm our commitment to the transformation of Port Moresby to a truly national capital,” he stated.
The four lane road was constructed by a local construction company Mobile Works. The ground breaking ceremony was held in 2020 and it was funded by the BSP Financial Group Limited at the guarantee of the national government.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Marape urged locals along the road to use the road for their economic benefit as well as to take proper care of the road.
“This road must return its investment to the country. I want to ask all our citizens to take ownership of this road. Don’t spit and litter on this road.
“Your government will work to give fines and penalties. It must start in the nation’s capital, live life, drive must be fitting of a modern infrastructure. No time for recklessness,” he warned.

BY PEARSON KOLOTHE last village of the Lower Lai constituency in the Wapenamanda Open Electorate in the Enga Province has finally been unlocked and connected to the outside world by road.This is after excavators from the Wapenamanda District Development Authority finally reached Tupokores, a village bordering Kompiam district and Baiyer Lumusa in the Western Highlands Province.
This road will continue into Lumusa and Baiyer and to Mt Hagen in due time.People living in these areas have shouldered coffee bags, garden produce and store goodsfor the past decades but these these struggles will be memories of the past as the road opens them up.This road construction is undertaken by Wapenamanda MP Miki Kaeok who is also the Vice Minister for Works and Highways.
Approximately 80 kilometres of roadworks have already been covered from Mambisanda near Wapenamanda to the last Tupokores village and will continue joining nearby Kompaim and eventually into Baiyer.This road is part of the National government’s Connect PNG road program and is expected to link Wapenamanda to Baiyer and to Madang through the Baiyer Madang Highway.

THE new Mount Bosavi road in the Nipa-Kutubu district of the Southern Highlands Province is pushing further into the thick jungles towards the mighty Tagali River.
Last week, the contractor and locals organised a small feast, a traditional practice to allow nature to release the land and the environment that has never being disturbed by humans, and to allow machines to cut through the forest.
If such special traditional offerings are not done then it is anticipated that they would encounter problems and bad luck in their efforts to build a road. 
After the feast, killing pigs and sprinkling pig’s blood, the machines are now cutting into the virgin forest toward the Tagali River.
The road, when completed, will serve more than 20,000 people locked away in that part of the country, located between Kutubu, Komo in Hela, Gulf and Middle Fly district in Western Province.
The Bosavi area is one of the world heritage sites, home to some of the unique plants and animals.
People from the area usually walk for more than four days through thick jungles to arrive at Waro in the Lower Foi of Lake Kutubu or fly by MAF to Mt Hagen.
Nipa-Kutubu MP Dr Billy Joseph made an initial funding of K5 million of the Nipa-Kutubu District Development Authority funds to buy bulldozers, excavators, trucks to start the process by cutting through thick virgin forest.
The 48-kilometre road, is part of the Government’s Connect PNG program but the most difficult part of the road is building an 800-metre at one of the narrow part over the Tagali River.

Obura-Wonenara MP John Boito has fulfilled his commitment to have an excavator to start working from the back of the district towards the front.He said he had made this commitment onboard a helicopter on his campaign run to Andakombi in Marawaka in the 2022 National General Elections with ward member Michael Kudea, who requested for an excavator, if he is elected. “I told him over Vailala mountain that today you sit with me in this helicopter, but if I win tomorrow, you will get an excavator,” Mr Boito said.“I could not forget this commitment because we made it in the air, not on the ground.”The excavator and a dump truck were driven to the Asakumdi community in ward eight of the Kome local level government area in Mynyamya district, Morobe Province, where road works will begin from towards Matawaka to wherever it meets with two more excavators working from Aiyura going backwards.Mr Boito said he would work with his colleague Solen Moifa to have this part of the country connected and continue to Sindeni to link up with the Trans-Highway to Gulf and Central Province now under construction.He also made it clear to the people that the Eastern Highlands provincial government, under the chairmanship of Simon Sia, is helping him to move the changes taking place in the district.Moks Takaje, on behalf of the Asakumdi community, reflected on the launching of the Obura-Wonenara district five-year development plan at the Aiyura Valley near Kainantu a month ago, which focuses on road infrastructure, including sending an excavator to the back of Marawaka to start work from there.“This has now been fulfilled and we now commit ourselves to work together,” Mr Takaje said.Robert Rodney, on behalf of the Marawaka community, said most of the people in this part of the country have no idea of what an excavator is.“We just celebrated our 48th independence anniversary last weekend and all those years, we have not had an excavator coming this way, even a dump truck for that matter,” Mr Rodney said.Mr Boito honoured this commitment one year and a month after the declaration of his election as the MP for Obura-Wonenara in the 2022 National General Elections and three days after the Papua New Guinea’s 48th independence celebrations nationwide on September 16, 2023. The people from the rolling mountains gathered at Asakumdi to welcome Mynyamya MP Solen Moifa and Eastern Highlands Governor Simon Sia who joined Mr Boito for the presentation of the excavator.Mr Sia assured them that more machines will be coming to speed up the work in connecting these isolated communities tucked away behind the rolling mountains and encouraged the young people to take their education seriously, adding that the government is committed to supporting human resource development program.Mr Moifa stressed the importance of road access to allow services into their areas, and appealed to his people to take ownership of the heavy equipment machines. including the ones working on the Mynyamya district road.He stressed on their cooperation in terms of letting their land for the development to take place and looking after the machineries and the workers.Mr Boito also stressed on the local cooperation as well.“We will celebrate when we launch the opening of the road,” Mr Boito said.“Now is not the time.”

BY MEROLYN TENENGA people are few kilometres away to enter the Sepik provinces via land transport as the construction phase of the huge Wuwai River log bridge had just been completed.Minister for Health and Wabag MP Dr Lino Tom said K10 million was in budget for the construction of the Enga-Sepik Highway because the Enga District Development Authority’s constructors have been engaged to do the road work.
He said it would be a milstone achievement for the country to connect provinces with only K10 million, for the fact that other road-links connecting provinces in the country cost more than a K100 million.“The log bridge over the Suwi River is complete now, while three new machines on the Pasalagus side (Wakem Area) are doing wet crossing over to Nelyaku to join one that was on that side.“Pilot tract is now at Nelyaku. We will head to Tapend Council Ward this month and then onwards to Poreak. It won’t go up to Poreak but swing right and cross lower Maramuni River and climb the last mountain range onto the Sepik plains,” Dr Lino said.
He said the road-link was currently going through the most difficult and dangerous terrains of lower Maramuni, and when it reaches Poreak- a village in lower Maramuni, it would cross over again over lower Maramuni river.“Finally, we will then ascend up a mid-size mountain (nothing compared to the ones we have already built through), and the Sepik plains will be in view from the summit.Upper Karawari, Penale village and others are at the base of this small mountain range where we would then descend onto the Sepik plains and head for Elem and then onto Biwat,”he said.
Dr Lino said that access was the most important enabler for all of basic government services to flow as it provides an equal platform for development.“We as a district are therefore prioritizing this so we leave no one behind in our pursuit of development.“When complete, this road will be one of the most important impact projects to be ever undertaken by the Enga province where, we have to connect with an emerging Economic giant, the East Sepik Province,” Dr Lino said.

The National Government, through the Department of Works and Highways (DoWH), will take full responsibility of the Wau-Bulolo Highway, which is in a deplorable state.In 2020, the Australia Government, through the AusAid Transport Sector Prepetory Project (TSSP), made a funding commitment of K66 million for the upgrade and sealing of the highway.However, the construction of this important road is progressing at a snail’s pace with the road left to deteriorate.Hence, the government under the Connect PNG Program is embarking on taking full funding and technical assistance to fast-track the construction phase.The Wau-Bulolo Highway begins from Lae 9 mile turnoff to Mumeng and towards Bulolo. It has been serving the Hidden Valley Gold Mine, Zenag Chicken Farm, Bulolo Forestry and the soon to be Wafi-Golpu Mine. These are key economic activities that has been contributing to the national coffers. It also serves as the nerve centre for the people of Mumeng, Bulolo, Wau-Waria, Menyamya, Aseki and Kaintiba.This important road link will soon connect Kerema in the Gulf Province and towards Hiritano Highway and into Port Moresby.
Minister for Works and Highways Solan Mirisim, Secretary David Wereh and senior officials from Port Moresby visited the Wau-Bulolo Highway yesterday.Mr Mirisim and Secretary Wereh both agreed that this road is one of the key economic roads and needs urgent government intervention.Mr Mirisim said after two years, there has been less progress done on road works.“The contractor has only achieved 25 kilometers of the 98 kilometers, with only patching potholes and minor works.“There has been no major rehabilitation or upgrade and sealing on this 25km.“I expect a very high standard of work, and our people of Wau, Bulolo demand the same.“By now we should see full upgrade and rehabilitation work, including sealing done for the Bulolo road and all that is supposed to happen under AusAid TSPP.“In saying that, I want to see the Wau- Bulolo Highway come under Connect PNG. We will break up the 98km into four sections and engage reputable contractors to work on this road immediately.”Mr Mirisim said apart from the Highlands Highway, the Wau- Bulolo Highway is also a busy highway.“This 98km road that begins from Lae 9 mile turnoff all the way to Bulolo needs a major upgrade and rehabilitation to the Highlands Highway standard.“This highway needs a similar program and it must be a replica of the standard used for the Highlands Highway, and we will get down to business immediately to see it happen.“I’m happy that my secretary, together with his deputy secretaries from the department, are physically on the ground to see the state of this highway.“It will now be our immediate task to find a lasting solution, and that is to work on a special intervention program that is similar to Highlands Highway arrangments.”Mr Mirisim further said that DoWH under Connect PNG will be funding this entire project.

A LOCAL microbank owned by the people of East New Britain has forecasted dramatic growth for the province over the next two to three years, made possible through the support of key economic enablers that are currently under construction.
Over the last 12 months of 2023 Kada Poroman Microfinance Ltd (KPML) has observed and monitored business and economic progress within Kokopo City and in the province.
Assistant marketing manager Joe Totabu said: “We have noted since the first quarter of 2023 construction of key infrastructure like roads, maintenance work on bridging systems and roads in all four districts,
“Pomio district is a strong growth centre and has been at the forefront in delivering key economic enablers including roads, bridges and socio/economic infrastructures,”
Kada Poroman has observed that these infrastructure developments in ENB have set the tone for a gradual increase of businesses and investments into Kokopo and the province.
“We have seen an increase in employment in the construction phase and the SME sector too,
“The SME sector has strongly displayed business growth and innovations…in relation to product and service development,” said Mr Totabu.
The bank also noted a shift into downstream processing in the agriculture and food industry at the SME level in ENB.
“On the investment front, we noted new investments and business growth in the retail sector, the gaming sector, construction sector.
“We also note business growth in the export/import, logistic and services and agriculture sector.
However, this industry provides the greatest opportunity for serious investors to tap into,” he said.
The bank also observed under the Connect PNG Program, that Kokopo and ENB will be receiving key infrastructure projects including;
Tokua Airport to Kokopo four lane highway redevelopment. A 14.6 km road costing K250 million. From Tokua all the way to Rabaul, the highway will be named Sir Rabbie Namaliu national highway.
Ragalona-Vesopuna Road in Pomio (Mamusi-Yana LLG). 34km at K2.7 million
Tokua Airport runway and aerodrome upgrade. Work has commenced by Hebou Construction.
Mr Totabu added that Kokopo has a robust banking and financial sector.
“Competition is very strong. A strong competition is healthy for business growth and innovation.
“We continue to see this sector directly supporting all sectors of the economy with needed capital support.
“The banking/financial sector is at the forefront in stimulating business and economic growth not just in ENB but the greater NGI region.
East New Britain is the centre of economic trade in the NGI region. Kokopo city is in fact the economic and business hub of the entire New Guinea Islands region.
The economy in ENB is powered by a strong sustainable agriculture sector in relation to oil palm, cocoa, copra, and balsa wood production plus fresh garden produce.

THE road maintenance and sealing of the Kiburu-Nipa section of the Highlands Highway is expected to be completed by June next year, managing director of Construct Oceanic Limited (COL) Sape Molume said.
He said Construct Oceanic Limited (COL) won the contract for the maintenance and sealing work and that they are adamant and confident the work will be completed by 2024, although it was anticipated to be completed by 2025.
Mr Molume said so far almost 5 kilometres of sealing work has been covered while clearing and grubbing and earthworks are up to 30 km out of 58km, while another 20 kms of line drainage, culverts, and gabion slope protections structure has been made so far.
He said in order to seal the road, crushing of sub-base or base course is in progress with four crushers to meet target volumes of over 200,000 m3 pavement and materials has been established.
He said by the end of the year, it is anticipated that earthworks, capping layer will have been completed up to 58 kilometers with 30km sealing yet to be completed.
He said others like site laboratory set up for quality control including a company owned troxler machine for compaction tests have been set up as well to speed up the progress.
“Four quarry sites including Kombu river gravel opened up, tested for conformance and materials approved for construction, this means road is already progressing.
“By the end, it is anticipated that earthworks, capping layer will have been completed up to 58 kilometers and 30 km of sealing works to be completed.
“The completion date is scheduled to be 2025 but COL anticipate to complete the project a year earlier by 2024.
“Construct Oceanic Limited is committed regardless of the economic situation and will deliver before the scheduled time frame,” he said.
Mr Molume was responding to concerns raised by the Member for Nipa-Kutubu Dr Billy Joseph who claimed that the Contract was very slow although two years has lapsed after the contract was awarded and signed in June 2021.
Secretary for Works and Highways David Wereh said an audit was carried out and recommendation have been forwarded to the Contactors to adhere to and make improvement.
He also blamed the attitude problem of the people for the delay as well.

The government’s Connect PNG program has hit a huge pothole.Former prime minister Peter O’Neill has likened Connect PNG to a scam, which has sparked a public debate with Prime Minister James Marape, with his Works and Implementation Minister Solan Mirisim weighing in to support Mr Marape.Messrs O’Neill and Marape have traded barbs on the CPNG project, a K20 billion project to be funded over the next 20 years to essentially link up all the major centres in Papua New Guinea.Mr Marape has been particularly rattled by assertions by Mr O’Neill that a certain contractor allegedly allied to the Prime Minister has been showered with contracts amounting to K3.5 billion.
Mr Marape hit back straight away yesterday, attacking Mr O’Neill’s “shady” reputation when he was prime minister.Prime Minister Marape denied having shareholding as claimed by O’Neill.Instead he said: “Peter O’Neill was known for giving contracts to his own companies, and foreign companies, unlike now where we have over 300 local companies operating in all corners of our country.”While the two were at it, East Sepik Governor Allan Bird, a government backbencher, questioned the processes and procedures for the application of the project.He said the project seems to have breached the Constitution and that funding planned for one year appears to overlap into the following year’s budget.Mr Bird questioned the validity of the program in a long post on his social media account (see separate story).Yesterday, Mr O’Neill released a statement alleging the Connect PNG program as a scam and documents given to him by concerned public servants, revealed a staggering amount of money being paid allegedly to close associates of Mr Marape.He singled out an alleged K3.5 billion contract awarded to Ipwenz Construction, including other contracts to Amaku and Sons Construction Ltd; Construct Oceanic Ltd; CivPac and Albe Ltd.“Only a proper, independent audit will establish all the facts of what has gone on and continues to go on with the Connect PNG program.”Mr Marape hit back straight away, saying Mr O’Neill had “a far shadier and dishonest reputation” of awarding contracts to his own companies during his time as prime minister.He said Mr O’Neill should take a good look at himself before tainting the reputations of Papua New Guinea contractors.“When Peter O’Neill points a finger at PNG contractors, there are four more pointing back at him,” Prime Minister Marape said when rebutting accusations by Mr O’Neill.Ipwenz Construction owner Moses Palipe denied his company has seen any of the amounts suggested by Mr O’Neill.He said that the former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia has stooped too low to raise serious allegation against Ipwenz Construction Limited.Yesterday, at a press conference with Sinasina Yongomugl MP Kerenga Kua and other Opposition MPs, O’Neill continued his attack on Connect PNG.“Our nation’s financial stability is at stake right under the noses of the International Monetary Fund and other donors such as China and Australia. There is no way that anybody knows about what is going on,” O’Neill said.“I understand there is a lack of confidence that the Commissioner of Police or the Ombudsman Commission are free to do their work and public servants feel they have nowhere else to turn to bring light to these allegations of serious misappropriation.”Works Minister Solan Mirisim defended the program supporting Prime Minister Marape that “The recent media statement by former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia that a single national contractor has been awarded a K3.5 billion worth contract was ridiculous, misleading and very cunning and deceptive allegation raised at this juncture of VONC.”He said: “Papua New Guineans must not forget that Peter O’Neill is known for inflated contracts creating huge debt traps that our government is currently clearing. He must be ashamed of records of uncontrolled spending on creating highways to nowhere and forgetting the rural road access serving 85% of the rural population. To come and point fingers at the Marape Government for building local contractors is very hypocritical and deceptive.”

Mando Andawayufa Community in Lower Asaro LLG in Daulo District in the Eastern Highlands built a road with spades to give vehicle access to the new high school.
Community leader Jackie Girupe said Mando Lutheran High School was on the same school grounds as the Primary School for over four years.
“Students are using the same facilities and due to space limitations, the landowners have given land to the church to erect a new high school.
Mr Girupe said the relocation of the high school needs road access to transport building supplies to the school.
He added several requests from the local community to the district MPs had not been successful, however, the community had taken action to construct the road themselves with spades, knives, and digging sticks.
Mr Girupe said the community led the initiative in 2020 using their bare hands to build the road to give vehicle access.
“Community had taken responsibility to make contributions in their own will to assist the construction of the road in the last few years.
The appeal for road access was finally heard by the provincial government under the leadership of Transport, Civil Works Division (TCWD) Director, Melki Zedeck Ohaeo who assisted with machines to fast-track the construction.
The machine’s valued assistance gave relief for the Mando-Andawayufa clan from their tiring digging and construction with their bare hands.
Mr Girupe said the road was completed recently with the help of TCWD.
He said the road will benefit over 200 students from the high school and teachers plus other staff commuting to school.
Mr Girupe said the road was a gift for the local community and district and especially the school with its students.
The community had named the newly established road after TCWD, Director “Melki Ohae”Mr Girupe said the Daulo District Development Authority and Eastern Highlands Provincial Administration and government will be assisting this year in the school’s relocation project.

The Government has spent over K400 million on the construction and expansion of Missing Link Roads throughout PNG over the last four years says Minister for Works and Highways, Solan Mirisim today in the Parliament.
Minister Mirisim said the returns on this will have a generational effect in the future.
He said the provincial and district roads makes up 21, 000 Km of the 30Km of PNG’s Road Network, serving 85 percent of the rural road network.
Mr Mirisim added that the record shows that his department and the Dept of National Planning and Monitoring have been continuously funding road projects worth more than K2 billion since 2019 supplementary Budget.
“This translates to an enormous 60 percent of the total connect PNG Capital Expenditure going to rural roads,” said Minister
He said Districts like Sinasina Yongomugl in Chimbu and Pangia Iyalibu in Southern Highlands on the opposition side are benefitting from this funding given directly from the national Planning department.
“More of the funding is going to the rural roads and under mutual obligations as compared to Past years.
“I asked all of us to make us of the funds to improve critical road infrastructure to improve and increase road connectivity and accessibility for our people to access services and markets to improve livelihoods,” Minister added.
He said that there are many road projects are financed directly at the provincial and district levels, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive and reliable assessment of achievements to date due to Data and information limitations.
Mr Mirisim said based on reports from the provinces, there are more than 40 percent (Approx. 1, 200 Km) of the phase 1 target of 3,000Km has been upgraded to a good condition.
