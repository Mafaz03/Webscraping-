By MICHAEL KOMATHE responsibility is on the district development authorities to maintain roads in their respective districts.Chuave man Simon Gunua said this after seeing many potholes on the 13 kilometre Chuave-Movi road in the limestone-riddled district.
He said the road was sealed in 2007 by a road construction company with funding made available under the PIP “but successive DDAs and the Simbu Provincial Government had failed to maintain the stretch.He said the National Government has saved Chuave’s district service improvement program (DSIP) allocation by financing that particular road infrastructure project “so the DDA should patch the potholes and rehabilitate deteriorated
portions”.Gumine man Urmil Sine has echoed similar sentiments saying the Kundiawa-Gumine road also needs maintenance, and gave examples of deteriorating portions and potholes on the 43 kilometre stretch.
The road was sealed with funding allocated by the same source in 1998 when Aulkupa Patrick was the local MP.Mr Sine said: “Hardly any maintenance was carried out on the district’s major trunk road since bitumen was applied 22 years
ago.”Four men in Eastern Highlands remote Okapa and Lufa areas have also called on their DDAs to allocate funds for the Korefeigu-Lufa and the Korefeigu-Okapa station roads that serve an estimated 110,000 people.
Tribal and youth leaders in Gembogl, Kerowagi (Chimbu), Nondugl and Banz (Jiwaka), Mul-Baiyer and Tambul-Nebilyer (Western Highlands) and Porgera (Enga) have also expressed similar concerns.They called upon their respective DDAs to maintain sealed (trunk) roads in the districts to enable smooth flow of traffic from the rural areas to urban centres.

Land and maritime project enhances climate Resilience of road network and wharves in Solomon Islands - Post Courier

The Land and Maritime Connectivity Project that is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is delivering results and is already boosting land and maritime connectivity and strengthening the transport network in Solomon Islands.
In keeping with ADB’s role as Asia and the Pacific’s climate bank, Solomon Islands’ vulnerability to floods and cyclones has been considered in designing the roads and wharves to be developed by the project, contributing to the enhancement of the disaster resilience of the country’s transport network. 
The project will improve the east–west corridor of Guadalcanal, which passes through central Honiara. This stretch of road is a lifeline for local people and allows them to access essential services and pursue socioeconomic activities. 
Given the importance of maritime transport for the country’s economy, the project will also better the Honiara International Port and develop wharves in the provinces of Makira-Ulawa and Rennell and Bellona.
The rehabilitation works on the 5-kilometer section from Henderson Airport along the Mberande road were completed in 2023, and the ones on the Tandai Highway are expected to be completed within 2024. 
Work underway in Honiara, Guadalcanal and shows the installation of underground stormwater drainage pipes.Mberande Road, Honiara, preparatory work before asphalt surfacing.
Preparatory work is underway for the rehabilitation of Honiara’s International Port and the construction of wharves at Ahanga and Kira Kira.
“The Land and Maritime Connectivity Project will be transformational for the population in Solomon Islands, particularly those who live in rural areas and need regular access to economic opportunities and basic services for stable livelihoods,” said ADB Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office Regional Director Shane Rosenthal. 
“The project will help provide all-year access to such opportunities and services, as climate-resilient features that have been integrated into the design of the project roads and wharves.” 
“This project will reshape land and maritime infrastructure in Solomon Islands,” said Acting Permanent Secretary for Infrastructure Development Allan Lilia. “It is already delivering results, carrying out rehabilitation work along the Mberande Road and toward Tandai Highway, which composes the critical road link on the Guadalcanal Island.”
The capacity of the Ministry of Infrastructure Development will be strengthened by the project, through support in planning, project preparation, procurement, and other transport sector institutional reform. 
As part of the institutional strengthening, the project will help the Ministry of Infrastructure Development develop a gender strategy and provide capacity development training programs to female staff.
The project is funded by a concessional loan of $74.4 million and a grant of $74.5 million from the Asian Development Fund, which provides grants to ADB’s poorest and most vulnerable developing member countries. 
The Government of the Solomon Islands is contributing the remaining $21.8 million of the project’s overall cost of almost $171 million.
ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members—49 from the region.

UPNG journalism studentProlonged road construc­tions along Port Moresby’s Waigani Drive has affected the lives of city residents but pretty soon it will cost people’s jobs and livelihoods.Since the construction commenced mid 2022, the Mobil Service Station operating next to the traffic lights, has been struggling to make sales and the management is at the verge of laying-off staff just to keep the business going.
According to Jack Tepu, managing director of Cobbie Car Rentals Limited, the company operating the Mobil Service Station, if the constructions do not conclude soon, several staff will have to be laid off.“If this continues we just cannot afford, in fact, we will go belly up and we are almost there, now we are struggling to keep up with all our cost.Real costs together with workers’ salaries and if we are not making that much sales, how do we stay alive? The road construction is killing us,’’ Mr Tepu said.
He said during the Christmas and New Year when the construction ceased operations their sales went up, and declined again when construction resumed this month.“They got families , they got children at school, they got to put bread and butter on the table, they live in the city and we do not want to leave them on the streets,” Mr Tepu said when considering laying off staff.Attempts to get comments from Global Constructions Limited was unsuccessful.
However, a senior worker at the construction site when asked on the delay in construction said the wet weather has significantly affected the work especially when asphalt was scheduled to be applied to the road.“Attempts to put asphalt on the road was disrupted by the weather, but asphalt is now expected to applied to the road on Sunday and that depends on the weather condition,” the worker who wished to remain anonymous said.While the construction impacts business houses, it was also noted that the lack of proper signs and directions along the road has confused many drivers.The general public in Port Moresby has been vocal on the impacts of traffic queues in recent weeks.Attempts to get comments from the National Capital District Commission were also unsuccessful.

https://gna.org.gh/2022/09/reconstruction-of-kpeshie-bridge-begins/

Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Accra, Sept 20, 2022 – Motorists and commuters who use the Accra-Tema Beach Road will have to brace themselves up for some gridlock along the stretch following the closure of a portion of the road for Reconstruction.  
The closure is to allow contractors working on the Accra-Tema Beach Road Expansion Project construct a new bridge across the Kpeshie Lagoon near La. 
The Bridge, which is expected to be completed in December this year, would replace the current one, including a bailey bridge that was put across the Lagoon to ease congestion on the stretch. 
This came to light when Mr Kwasi Amoako-Atta, the Minister of Roads and Highways, paid a working visit to the site to gain first hand information on the project. 
Briefing the Minister, Mr Kweku Attakow Diafo, the Resident Engineer in charge of the project, said one of the two bailey bridges, which connected La to Teshie would be removed to enable construction works to begin.  
The scope of work includes an 80 metre two-way four-lane and auxiliary works.  
At the time of the visit, pilling works for the erection of concrete pillars had begun. 
To minimise the impact of the construction works on motorists and commuters, Mr Diafo said the two out of the remaining three lanes on the stretch would be made accessible to motorists heading towards Accra during the morning peak hours and a reverse of same during the evening rush hours. 
That, he said was to reduce traffic on the Accra-bound side of the Bridge in the morning and the Tema-bound side in the evening. 
Mr Amoako-Atta, who tasked the contractor to complete the project within schedule, appealed to commuters to bear with the inconveniences that would come with the work. 
He described the inconvenience as a necessary evil and said the Ministry had made arrangements with the police to manage the situation and urged motorists to adhere to safety measures in and around the site. 
“We are concerned about motorists and commuters alike, hence we have put in place measures to ease their burden,” he said. 
The Bridge, one of the three, being constructed under phase one of the Accra-Tema Beach Road Expansion Project, facilitates the flow of water from the Kpeshie Lagoon into the sea. 
In August 2022, the Vice-President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, cut the sod for the reconstruction of the Accra-Tema Beach Road. 
The 26.6-km project, which is estimated at $100 million, starts from the Independence Arch in Accra to Tema Community Three.  
Work on the first phase of the 16-kilometre road, which starts from the Independence Arch of the Black Star Square in Accra through Osu, La and Teshie to Nungua, is being undertaken by CGICETC, while the second phase of 10.6 kilometres — which spans Nungua to Tema Community Three — is being handled by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Group Company Limited (CRMBEGCL). 
The work includes a two-way, four-lane urban road; a traffic signal system and related auxiliary works.  
When completed, the road will serve as a major alternative route to the Accra-Tema Motorway.

BY MEROLYN TENFOUR-lane road from Kagamuga to Keltiga Junction in Mt Hagen City, Western Highlands province, has been described as a death- trap by several road users.The four-lane highway in the middle of town is being discussed in PMV buses along with other travelling citizens, given the fact that there were no proper bus stops, the road is too small for big highway container carriers,
not enough crossing marks for the pedestrians, continuous road accidents causing death and traffic lights that have been out of action for a couple of years.These concerns were made known to the Western Highlands Province Governor Wai Rapa.Mr Rapa said that the four-lane road was very expensive and a gift from the National Government that was needed to be appreciated by the people of Western Highlands Province and daily road users.
“The bus stops, crossing signs and traffic lights would soon be fixed as they were already on the provincial government’s plan.However, it was only the carelessness of drivers and road users who drive beyond the speed limitations, plus accidents are happening as drivers are speeding under the influence of alcohol or the vehicles not being serviced and road unworthy,” Governor Rapa said.He said the four-lane road was a very important and modernised development in the province and leave drivers with a smooth and comfortable experience when travelling.
“It is the people or the drivers are causing the continuous road accidents and not the road,” Rapa said.
Governor Rapa has urged the general public who have been using the four- lane road to take precautions and avoid careless driving.

Construction has resumed on the 10-kilome­tre Kotokrom-Yawhima dual-carriage road of the Sunyani-Techiman highway after contractors abandoned site due to lack of funds.
Ms Justina Owusu Banahene (inset) briefing the press after touring the road project
At least 4.8km stretch of one side of the dual-carriage road has been tarred.
These came to light when the Bono Regional Minister, Justina Owusu Banahene, undertook an inspection tour of the project over the weekend, saying that efforts were underway to mobilise resources to complete the road project on time.
The Ghanaian Times gathered that the deplorable nature of that stretch of the highway had been a major concern for residents living along the highway. 
GHS calls for forensic probe into conduct of Internal Audit Director
As at November 30, this year, the road had received the first prima sealing awaiting the second sealing and it is expected to be opened to motorists within a week’s time.
The road project was award­ed on contract by the previous administration and work stalled after a few kilometres of the New Dormaa-Kotokrom stretch of the highway was asphalted.
The current government upon assumption of power in 2017 also awarded the road project to a dif­ferent contractor, but work on it experienced several setbacks with uncountable delays.
The regional minister speaking to the media during the tour said the Regional Coordinating Council (RCC) was working hard to ensure poor road networks in the Bono Region were given the needed facelift to enhance socio-economic development.
She conceded that it was regrettable that some major road networks in the region were in deplorable conditions, and assured that work would begin on them soon.
The Assemblyman for Ko­tokrom Electoral Area, Dramani Mahama, commended the govern­ment for listening to the plight of people and bringing contractors to site to complete the project.
He expressed the hope that the project would not suffer another setback and it would be completed on time t

TBDA appeals for construction of Dunkwa-on-Offinso to Buabin road - Ghanaian Times
			TBDA appeals for construction of Dunkwa-on-Offinso to Buabin road		
The Twifo Buabin Development Association (TBDA) has appealed to the Minister of Roads and Highways, Akwasi Amoako Atta, to as a matter of urgency, construct the road from Dunkwa – On – Offin to Buabin in the Central Region.
The Association said the road had been in a very bad state for over a decade and was hampering developmental activities in the area.
This was contained in a statement signed and issued by the Secretary of the Twifo Buabin Development Association, Justice Nana Banful and copied to the Ghanaian Times in Accra yesterday.
“We say this because in 2006, the government of Ghana and the Buabin community came into an agreement that the road within the Buabin enclave especially the Dunkwa – Buabin stretch would be tarred if the Adontenhene of Twifo Mampong Paramouncy, Okofo Kofi Buabin released a large tract of land for the cultivation of oil palm to feed the Twifo Oil Palm Plantations (TOPP) factory at Ntafrewaso. The Buabin stool honored its side of the agreement,” he said.

Mr Banful added that the Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo- Addo led administration had also pledged to construct the road with “several letters and personal contacts with the road minister have all proved futile.”
For that reason, he said there was the pressing need for the constituency’s feats chalked over the years particularly in winning the national farming awards to be recognised
“Apart from the Dunkwa municipality which has its inner township roads tarred. All the adjourning communities – namely Buabin, kontokrom, Sobroso and Adjom. The rest are Imbraim, Kwakudum, Agyempoma, Twifo Kyebi among others have not seen bitumen resurfacing,” he said.
“There is not even one non – governmental organiSation to assist the constituency’s development; thereby making the place under developed,” he added.
The Secretary of the Buabin Development Association said that because the area lacked ministerial appointments, lobbying for development was difficult.

The Vice President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, yesterday inaugurated a rehabilitated and upgraded 22-kilometre Cape Coast Inner-City Road project undertaken to improve the road network in the Cape Coast metropolis.
The project, which was part of the Phase I Agreement between the Government of Ghana and the Sinohydro Corporation, focused on addressing the poor nature of roads in the area as some of them became impassable during the rainy season.
Interventions taken as part of the project included construction of drains and culverts, rehabilitation works involving dressed surface, as well as traffic management and safety works.
Communities directly benefitting from the road project were Akotokyir, Kwaprow, Amamoma, Academy area, English Arabic area, PPAG area, Ebubonko-Amssano-Besakrom-Dankwakrom, Eyifua and Kakumdo. 
Dr Bawumia, in an address during the inauguration, stated that the completion of the project had proved critics of the current administration wrong as they doubted its execution when it was announced.
He indicated that the construction of the Cape Coast inner city road was part of a master project between the Government of Ghana and the People’s Republic of China through the Sinohydro Corporation.
The Vice President said under the phase I of the Sinohydro master project support, 441 kilometres of roads and two inter-changes areto be constructed, and its objective is to enhance intra-urban, regional and national traffic flow, strengthen regional and traffic integration and improve trade.
“The completion of the project has improved accessibility within beneficiary communities in Cape Coast,” he said.
Dr Bawumia further stated that apart from the construction of the Cape Coast inner city roads, other contracts such as the Tamale interchange, and upgrading of selected feeder roads in Ashanti and Western regions had also been completed and inaugurated.
“Currently, there are three lots under the Sinohydro project that are at various stages of completion.
The Kumasi Inner city road, construction of Takoradi-PTC interchange and construction of the Sunyani inner city road, he said, were at various stages of completion.
The Minister for Roads and Highways, Kwasi Amoako-Atta, in an address, indicated that the Central Region had a total road network of 5,695.5km as at the end of 2020, explaining that “there are 1,880 kilometres of paved roads, 2,320.6 kilometres of gravel roads, and 1,494.8 kilometres of earth roads”.
He explained that the regional road condition was mixed because getting to the end of 2020, 24percentwas good, 37 percent fair, and 39 percent poor.
The Ministry of Roads and Highways, he said, had developed a strategy to increase the percentage of roads in good condition by undertaking various periodic maintenance activities.
The strategies, he said, included asphalt overlays, resealing, minor rehabilitation and upgrading, partial reconstruction and gravelling, and re-gravelling.
The Chinese Ambassador to Ghana, Lu Kun, in his address, said the rehabilitation of selected roads and interchanges in Ghana-Phase I agreement between the Government of Ghana and the Sinohydro Corporation had set a good example of mutual friendship between Ghana and China.
He expressed optimism that the projects under the agreement would serve well the development agenda of Ghana in the near future.
The Paramount Chief of the Oguaa Traditional Area, Osabarima Kwesi Atta II, in his remarks, expressed appreciation to the government for executing the project.
He also appealed to the government to work towards improving the rest of theroad network in the Cape Coast metropolis andthose in other areas within the region.

Govt to dualise Peduase to Koforidua stretch of Madina-Koforidua road - Minister - Ghanaian Times
			Govt to dualise Peduase to Koforidua stretch of Madina-Koforidua road – Minister		
 Mr Seth Kwame Akyeampong (fourth from right) with other dignitaries
The government is considering the dualisation of the Peduase to Koforidua stretch of the Madina-Koforidua road, the Eastern Regional Minister, Mr Seth Kwame Akyeampong, has disclosed.
He said the decision apart from completing the dualisation of the full Medina-Koforidua road would also open up the region for investment and tourism.
Speaking at the Sunday edition of the bi-weekly Minister’s briefing organised by the Ministry of Information in Accra, he said plans were at the advanced stages and soon work would commence.
The Minister explained that the region had about 7,400 kilometres of road network, but less than 260 kilometres had been paved with very minimal asphalt overlay. 
Traditional, religious leaders urged to help abolish negative cultural practices
However, he said from 2017 up to today the region under the current administration had seen over 570 kilometres of the roads receiving asphaltic overlay.
Apart from that, he noted that government had awarded 5,400 kilometres of road on contract and 1,487 kilometres had been completed for use so far.
The roads, he said, were made up of 206 urban roads, 3,860 feeder roads and595 Highways.
Mr Acheampong further explained that when the current government assumed power there were only 260 kilometres motorable asphaltic roads in the region but right now this had given way to massive improvement in the region with over 100 works in asphalt overlay.
Apart from the numerous road projects, the Minister said the region had received significant investment in other areas including health and education.
In the area of education, he said the government had provided a number of infrastructure for learning and this included, state-of-the-art Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) school at Abomosu,  theTechnical Vocational Education and Training (TVET)centre at AkyemAnyinam, the vocational institute at Kitase- Akuapem, Phase I of the University of Environment and Sustainable Development, two-storey and a 12-unit classroom block at Abuakwa State College in Kyebi.
In addition, was a 12-unit classroom block at ManyaKrobo SHS, 2-storey boys’ dormitory block for Akroso SHS, a 15 unit classroom block at Okuapeman SHS, and a 14-unit classroom block at Bepong SHS, among others.
In the area of health, the Minister said in line with government’s vision to create and expand access to health care and enhance the quality of health service delivery in the region, various development projects in the health sector in the region had been commenced and were progressing steadily with some already completed.
“The renovation of the TettehQuarshie Memorial Hospital, Completion of the Aburi Hospital, construction of the Eastern Regional Hospital, the completion of the Somanya District Hospital, modernisation of the Kibi District Hospital, construction of the 40-bed Maternity Hospital at Enyiresi, all formed part,” he said.
He, therefore, appealed to Ghanaians to support the government to fix the problems of the country.

NPA regulates on import, storage, processing, marketing of bitumen January - Ghanaian Times
			NPA regulates on import, storage, processing, marketing of bitumen January		
The National Pe­troleum Authority (NPA) will from January next year commence regulation of the importation, storage, processing and marketing of bitumen in the country.
The new regulatory framework, which will have inputs from the Ghana Standards Authority (GSA), the Ghana Highways Authority (GHA), and the Customs Division of the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA), seeks to streamline the bi­tumen supply chain and to ensure compliance with national quality standards.
The new framework spells out who qualifies to obtain a licence, the national standards for Bitu­men and guidelines to follow for the supply of the product among other things.
Director of Economic Regu­lation and Planning at NPA, Mrs Alpha Welbeck, who made the disclosure at a media briefing in Accra, urged industry players to use the remaining period of 2023 to regularise their operations with the Authority. 
Ghana loses 6 billion dollars yearly in mining sector —Dr Abdallah Ali-Nakyea
“Existing bitumen facilities and new entrants will have to acquire a license before they will be allowed to operate in the industry begin­ning 2024,” she stated.
Mrs Welbeck said that currently, bitumen which was a by-product of crude oil was sourced from both local oil producers and im­ported by private companies.
Despite its importance, she said, little had been done in terms of monitoring and regulation of the product as compared to the other petroleum products such as petrol, diesel, LPG etc.
“The bitumen industry possess­es enormous potential to contrib­ute to the growth and develop­ment of the economy due to its use in road construction.
We have taken the decision to collaborate with all other stake­holders including the Customs Division of the GRA, GSA to develop a regulatory framework that will not only ensure its proper storage and processing but also enhance investments in that area,” Mrs Welbeck stated.
In 2014, she said, the NPA conducted a study to ascertain the supply chain practices and to obtain some baseline information of happenings in the bitumen industry.
She explained that, following the study, the NPA together with stakeholders such as the GHA, GRA – Customs Division, GSA and some existing players, have collaborated in the development of guidelines for the supply of bitumen, culminating into a new regulatory framework set to be implemented in January 2024.
The NPA, she said, would, in the coming weeks, issue a public notice on the requirements for ob­taining a license to enable existing players and new entrants to take the necessary steps in regularising their operations ahead of the 2024 deadline.

			Veep cuts sod for work to begin on $26m 3rd tier Tema Motorway Interchange		
Vice President Bawumia (fourth from left) cutting the sod for the commencement of the project
The Vice President, Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, has cut sod for work to begin on a third-tieron the Tema Motorway Interchange.
The project to be constructed on the existing second-tier is estimated at $26 million and expected to be completed in 30 months.
It involved the construction of 1.8-kilometre interchange to directly link Tema Harbour and the Ashaiman roundabout.
Additionally the project shall have covered drains, pedestrian walkways, public transport facilities and street lights 
﻿African govts urged to mainstream ﻿population issues in devt planning
It is to be undertaken by Messrs JFE Engineering Corporation.
Dr Bawumia speaking at the ceremony said the interchange will bring to over 12, the number of interchanges that the government of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has either completed or is working on.
“These interchanges that government is either working on or completed he stated would greatly enhance the socio-economic development of the country as they are all part of measures to improve traffic flow between Tema Harbour and other parts of the country,” he added.
He said in addition the Tema Motorway would be upgraded into an eight-lane facility that will include a four-lane expressway with three service lanes on either side as well as a number of foot bridges to link the Community 18 junction interchange.
Dr Bawumia said preparatory works and financing arrangements are being finalised and surely the government would also undertake that project successfully.
He said the Tema Motorway interchange phase two will involve the construction of the viaduct to link the Harbour road towards the Ashaiman roundabout on the Flower Pot road, adding that the 17 km project would involve the provision of service lanes and four interchanges between Tema Motorway roundabout and Michel Camp and progress of work stands at 30 per cent.”
Dr Bawumia said construction of the Tema Beach road at Kpeshie is 70 percent complete, the Nungua 3-tier interchange at 82 percent, the Borteymanroad 70 percent and the Dome Kitase 23 percent complete.
 He said the Greater Accra Region has benefited from an Asphalt overlay of 413 kilometres from 2021 to date bringing the total asphalt overlay works completed in the region to 947 km since 2017.
The Vice President commended the government and people of Japan through the Japan International Cooperation Agency who have provided grant funding for the project and urged the supervising agencies to ensure it was completed ahead of schedule.
The Japanese Ambassador to Ghana, Hisanobu Mochizuki, said his country’s support is a testimony of the deep and long standing friendship between the two countries aimed at supporting the country’s road infrastructure.
He urged the government and the supervising agencies to effectively provide that strong leadership needed towards ensuring that the project was effectively implemented without delay.
The Country Director of JICA, Araki Yasumichi, said transport infrastructure has been one of the most important areas of cooperation between the two countries and urged for more partnerships for the mutual benefit of both parties.
The Minister of Roads and Highways, Mr Kwasi Amoako-Atta, urged residents and motorists to bear with the contractor during the period and assured that the project would be done according to specification to ensure the country gets value for money.

https://gna.org.gh/2022/11/sand-mining-is-a-form-of-galamsey-in-volta-region-dr-letsa/

'Sand mining is a form of galamsey in Volta Region' - Dr Letsa  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
‘Sand mining is a form of galamsey in Volta Region’ – Dr Letsa 
Accra, Nov.10, GNA – Dr Archibald Yao Letsa, the Volta Regional Minister, says illegal sand mining in the Keta and Ketu North districts of the Region is “a form of galamsey that must be dealt with decisively”. 
He said the illegal phenomenon was being undertaken at dawn by some unscrupulous people in the Region, thus wreaking havoc on the environment compelling the Regional Security Council to constitute a taskforce to halt the practice. 
Dr Letsa said this in Accra when he took his turn at the Minister’s briefing dubbed: “The State of the Region Report”. 
In Keta and North Tongu, the issue is serious. We are trying to fight it and so we have established a task force to help the Municipal Security Council to address this canker,” Dr Letsa assured. 
“The sea defence was done to protect the Keta coast and we are now undermining the sea protection wall through the sand mining,” the Minister lamented. 
The Minister, therefore, urged all stakeholders to join forces to fight the canker. 
On development infrastructure in the past five years, Dr Letsa said, the government had worked to improve the motorable sections of the Eastern Corridor Road from 30 per cent to about 80 per cent. 
Dr Letsa gave the assurance that the crucial road network which connected the Greater Accra Region to the Northern Region was being given the necessary attention and only about 30 per cent of the eastern corridor road had been in good condition by December of 2016. 
It included portions of the Hohoe-Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu section, which was in terrible condition, as well as the 62-km Nkwanta to Oti Damanko section, and the 96-km Oti-Damanko to Yendi road, which he claimed were not in good state. 
However, he said, in the last six years, significant portions of those roads had witnessed massive improvement.  
They include the 53-km (about 32.93 mi) km Have-Hohoe portion, of which 35km was now in good condition. About 22km of 30km Hohoe-Jasikan road which was completely unmotorable had now seen a major upgrade. 
The Jasikan-Dodo Pepesu road, which was completely unmotorable, was built and served the adjoining communities. 
The Oti-Damanko to Yendi road (96km) and the Yendi-Gushegu road (68km) in deplorable states were completed. 
In all, he said, about 360km of the 457km eastern corridor road, representing about 75 per cent of the Asikuma Junction – Gushegu road network has been made motorable. 
There was also the dualisation of the Ho main road, with traffic management works as well as the dualization of the Ho-Sokode roads, the Minister stated. 
The Hohoe town roads were also seeing a facelift with asphalt being overlaid on the 15 km stretch of roads. Klefe town roads were also being upgraded. 
The 16km Akweteh to Adaklu Waya road, and the Agbonyira-Fodome Ahor roads also underwent some bitumen surfacing, while the Dzolokpuita-Bame cocoa road had also been upgraded. 
Some bridges had also been constructed to connect some cut off communities including the construction of a- 70km (about 43.5 mi) steel span bridge on the Galosota-Bomingo feeder road, the construction of the 175km spine steel bridge linking Agbenorxoe to Kpando.
