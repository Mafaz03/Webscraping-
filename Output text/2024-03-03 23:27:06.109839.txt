In Beijing this week, the tenth-year milestone of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be marked at a forum that highlights this often-debated model for economic development.
Large signs reading "The Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation" are displayed next to a bustling Beijing road. The previous forums convened in 2017 and 2019.  
This program, championed by China's President Xi Jinping, has provided funding for numerous global infrastructure projects, including ports, power plants, and railways. Nevertheless, the initiative has received criticism for its approach to providing loans to developing nations, which often results in them incurring substantial debt.
Wang Yiwei, the Director of the Institute of International Affairs at China's Renmin University, asserts that BRI encourages a collaborative approach to development with partner nations, providing them with paths to modernization.
Recent events, such as the construction of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in Indonesia, which commenced earlier this month, underscore the mixed reception BRI has encountered. While this 142-kilometer railway significantly reduces travel time between Jakarta and Bandung, it was marred by delays and escalating costs. Originally expected to launch in 2019, disputes over land acquisition, environmental concerns, and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the project. Furthermore, the estimated cost of 66.7 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion USD) ballooned to 113 trillion rupiah ($7.3 billion USD).
Similarly, the $5.9 billion Chinese-built railway linking Laos' capital, Vientiane, to the southern Chinese city of Kunming began operations in 2021, with over 60% of the investment being borrowed – an unusually high percentage for an infrastructure project, according to foreign experts. This has led to the initiative being perceived by some as a "debt trap."
Chinese contractors are also constructing a high-speed rail line from Bangkok to the Laos border, expected to be operational by 2028.
An example of a debt issue emerged earlier this year when a power plant in Jordan, once touted as a groundbreaking project to provide the country with a significant energy source, turned sour. Jordan now finds itself in an international legal battle and billions of dollars in debt to China for a plant that is no longer necessary for its energy needs, due to subsequent agreements made since the project's inception.
A "risk prevention" approach will be critical for the future of the Belt and Road Initiative, given the growing complications in a world marked by ongoing conflicts.
The Belt and Road Initiative Forum is scheduled to commence on October 18.

African leaders arrive in Beijing for third Belt and Road Forum
                                                      Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed arrives at Beijing Capital International Airport to attend the Third Belt and Road Forum in Beijing, Monday, Oct. 16, 2023.
                                                                                    -  
Some 130 leaders from Africa, South America and other emerging markets are gathering in China for a meeting organized by the Chinese government that will mark the 10th anniversary of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
Denis Sassou N'guesso of The Congo, Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed and Nigeria's Kashim Shettima arrived Monday (Oct. 16) in Beijing.
Other leaders who arrived on Monday included Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe, Papua New Guinean Prime Minister James Marape and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet.
Chilean President Gabriel Boric and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán on Sunday. Others are coming on Tuesday.
The summit kicking off on October 17th, is the third Belt and Road Forum for international cooperation.
The BRI is a plan that China launched a decade ago. Under the initiative, a signature policy of president Xi Jinping, Chinese companies have built infrastructures including ports, roads and power plants around the world in a bid to boost trade and economic growth.
One decade down the line, some observers say the Initiative may be losing steam as Beijing becomes more averse to risk and as the domestic economy struggles to bounce back to pre-pandemic growth levels.
The main events of the two-day meeting are scheduled on Wednesday. Global organizations will also be in attendance.
                                                                                    00:56

Kenyan President William Ruto arrives in China for Belt and Road Forum
                                                      Kenya's President William Ruto poses during a photo session at the Palais Brongniart for the New Global Financial Pact Summit in Paris on June 22, 2023.
                                                                                    -  
Kenyan President William Ruto has arrived in Beijing to participate in the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, scheduled for two days in the Chinese capital.
This forum holds great diplomatic significance for China, as it's the most important event of the year and a notable celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
Over 140 countries and 30 international organizations, including leaders, officials, and representatives from various sectors, have confirmed their participation.
The Belt and Road Initiative, initiated by China in 2013, aims to create trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia, Europe, Africa, and beyond along the historic Silk Road trade routes.
In the past decade, over 150 countries and 30 international organizations have engaged with the BRI framework, marking a significant milestone in global cooperation.
William Ruto intends to ask China for a $1 billion loan and a debt repayment restructuring plan, the country's vice-president said on Friday.
According to Rigathi Gachagua, the head of state, who criticized his predecessor's heavy borrowing from Beijing, will visit China at an unspecified date. He will ask for "more time to slowly repay the debt", as well as a billion dollars to complete road projects delayed by lack of funding.
Kenya, one of East Africa's largest economies, has accumulated more than $68 billion in debt, equivalent to 67% of its gross domestic product.
"We are a responsible government, we can't say we won't pay the debt," Rigathi Gachagua told a local radio station.
China, which William Ruto has not visited since his election in August 2022, is the country's second-largest creditor, after the World Bank.
In Mombasa, East Africa's largest port on the Kenyan coast, it is financing the construction of a new terminal.
Beijing has also lent $5 billion (€4.7 billion) for the realization of the most expensive infrastructure project since the country's independence in 1963: the train line that since 2017 has linked the port city of Mombasa to Naivasha, in the Rift Valley, via the capital Nairobi.
During the election campaign, William Ruto had denounced the loans of his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta, pledging to find other ways of stimulating development to build the country's necessary infrastructure.
China has rejected criticism that its lavish loans are plunging some countries, particularly in Africa, into debt overload.
During a visit to Kenya in July, Beijing's head of diplomacy, Wang Yi, praised bilateral cooperation and a "win-win" partnership.
Despite a dynamic economy, around a third of Kenya's population lives in poverty.
Economic growth slowed to 4.8% last year, from 7.6% in 2021, hit by the global fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a devastating regional drought that hit the country's vital agricultural sector.
Inflation remained high, at an annual rate of 6.8% last month.
In July, global ratings' agency Fitch Ratings downgraded Kenya's ability to repay international lenders from "stable to negative", citing tax hikes and social unrest.

A group of intrepid explorers from Ghana, led by Kwabena Peprah, has undertaken a remarkable cross-continental road trip spanning over 10,000 kilometers.
Starting from Accra, the capital of Ghana, their expedition took them through numerous African countries and European destinations, culminating in a journey from one continent to another, according to reports.
The travellers, known as Wanderlust Ghana, are a diverse group of philanthropists and tourism enthusiasts. The team initially consisted of 13 members, including individuals such as Richard Anim, Kwadwo Saka, Kwame Peprah, Kofi Peprah, and others. One member dropped out due to work commitments in Senegal, and two others left the expedition in Morocco.
Their route began in Accra, weaving through various Ghanaian cities including Aburi, Nsawam, Kumasi, and Sunyani, before crossing into neighbouring Cote d'Ivoire. From there, they ventured through Mali, Senegal, Mauritania, and Morocco, finally entering Europe through Spain via a Mediterranean ferry. Their journey showcased the diverse terrains and climates of Africa and Europe.
The expedition involved an array of vehicles, including a Mercedez Benz G-Wagon, a Toyota Landcruisers (V8), Lexus RX 350, and a Ford F150 Raptor. The team covered an average of 800 to 900 kilometers per day, consuming around 250 liters of fuel daily. Their progress was documented through videos shared on social media, revealing the challenges faced, including brake pad changes and interactions with local authorities.
A unique addition to the team was Nana Afua Serwaa, nicknamed "Shecanic," an auto repair technician aiming to master automobile mechanics across various landscapes and climates.
The journey not only showcased the team's adventurous spirit but also aimed to raise funds for rural primary schools in Ghana. The adventurers were inspired by stories of people travelling from Europe to African nations by road and decided to reverse the journey, with the goal of generating media attention and support for their philanthropic cause.

Upon reaching the outskirts of Monaco, Kwabena Peprah emphasized their motivation for the expedition, citing their passion for exploration and their desire to contribute to underserved communities through their philanthropic organization, EduSpots.
Despite encountering challenges, such as an extended delay due to an encounter with authorities in Mauritania, the team expressed admiration for certain countries along the route, particularly Senegal and Morocco, for their beauty, cleanliness, infrastructure, and friendly locals.
As their journey neared its end, the team anticipated a warm reception in London, where they planned to engage with the Ghanaian community and the Ghana High Commission to further their philanthropic endeavors.
With this epic journey serving as a testament to human determination and a drive to make a positive impact, Wanderlust Ghana's road trip from Accra to London stands as an inspiring example of adventure, philanthropy, and cross-cultural exchange.

China cuts lending as Belt and Road shifts focus [Business Africa]
                                                      Business Africa presenter Ronald Kato (Left) during the interview with Kanyi Lui, partner and head of China at Pinsent Masons (Right)
                                                                                    -  
Since 2013, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has helped bankroll a boom in African infrastructure, allowing credit-starved countries to build railways, hydropower projects, roads, airports and communications.
The initiative also led to a surge in Chinese investment in areas such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture.
The program has made Beijing the biggest financier of infrastructure in Africa.
But a decade down the road, some observers say the Belt and Road Initiative may be losing steam as Beijing becomes more averse to risk and as the domestic economy struggles to return to pre-pandemic growth levels.
Our guest this week is Kanyi Lui, a partner and head of China at Pinsent Masons.
Kanyi has decades of experience in international project finance and has provided legal services to several Belt and Road projects around the world.
Nearly every business lost something during the political unrest in Senegal in early June. The damage to the west African country's economic output was estimated at $33 million per day.
With President Macky Sall's announcement that he won't be seeking re-election next year, businesses are hoping to rebuild and to flourish.
Nigeria's inflation has not eased since the beginning of 2023. Prices continued to climb in June, following the end of a fuel subsidy in May.
Inflation has been in double-digits in Africa's biggest economy since 2016, eroding savings and incomes.

Senegalese transporters on strike against road safety measures
                                                      Senegal
                                                                                    -  
The transport sector in Senegal went on strike this Wednesday. A number of unions joined forces to denounce the measures taken on  January 9 to combat road insecurity.
A plan announced in the wake of the deadly accident in the department of Kaffrine. But some transporters protest against the lack of consultation, and the impossibility of applying certain measures.
On Monday, the fatal bus accident cost the life of at least 19 people, bringing the death toll of car crashes to about 60 in a matter of days. 
The government responded by announcing nearly two dozen measures, including limiting buses and trucks to 90 kilometres per hour (56 mph), banning night buses and outlawing the import of used tyres -- the suspected cause of last week's accident. However, some transport unions called certain dispositions out of touch with reality and lifestyles.
According to the World Bank, Senegal, a country of 17 million, records 24 road deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants annually.

                                                      Authorities said early investigations suggested the passenger bus suffered a burst tyre and swerved off course, colliding head on with another oncoming bus 
                                                                                    -  
Thirty-nine people were killed and more than 100 others injured when two buses crashed in a head-on collision overnight on an arterial road in Senegal's central Kaffrine region, President Macky Sall told reporters Sunday.
Images of the incident showed the completely mangled front end of a white bus, with blood-flecked seats, personal items and a shoe strewn around the tree-lined crash site.
Road accidents are common in Senegal, largely because of driver error, poor roads and decrepit vehicles, say experts, but the latest disaster has caused one of the heaviest losses of life from a single incident in recent years.
Speaking to reporters, Sall corrected an earlier government statement that had put the death toll at 40, citing a miscount at the morgue.
He made the comments after visiting the crash site, on the No. 1 national highway just outside of the village of Sikilo, and speaking with some of the injured at the regional hospital in the nearby town of Kaffrine.
"We note with great pain and sadness the death of 39 people in this traffic accident near Kaffrine", Sall said.
"We have lost many young people in this accident and tomorrow the Prime Minister will convene an interministerial council that will involve the world of transport -- transporters, drivers, insurers, security services -- to look at the measures to be taken", he added.
The government has announced three days of national mourning beginning Monday, with flags to be flown at half-mast throughout the country.
Kaffrine mayor Abdoulaye Saydou Sow, who is also the Minister of Urbanism, said in a statement that the accident occurred between 2:00 and 3:00 am (GMT and local) Sunday and was caused by a burst tyre.
He said the Kaffrine morgue was "saturated" and that bodies were being sent to another morgue in Kaolack, a city 40 miles (65 km) away.
Public prosecutor, Cheikh Dieng, had previously said in a statement that early investigations suggested a public passenger bus suffered a burst tyre and swerved off course.
It then crashed "head-on with another bus coming in the opposite direction", he said.
Sow said he and several other ministers had visited the injured in Kaffrine and Kaolack on Sunday.
The delegation included the Minister of Land Transport, Mansour Faye, Health Minister Marie Kermesse Ngom, and Minister of Territorial Equity and National Solidarity, Samba Ndiobene Ka, he said.
The president of the National Assembly, Amadou Mame Diop, said in a statement that he "and all the Members of Parliament share the grief of the entire Senegalese people" and commended "the rapid response of the emergency services".
Opposition politician Ousmane Sonko announced on Twitter that he would postpone a scheduled fundraising program in light of the accident.
"We bow before the memory of the deceased, offer our very sincere condolences to their grieving loved ones and to all Senegalese and pray for the merciful rest of their souls as well as a speedy recovery for the injured", he said.
France's Minister of Foreign Affairs on Sunday conveyed her condolences to her Senegalese counterpart, the French ministry said in a statement.
In October 2020, at least 16 people were killed and 15 more injured when a bus collided with a refrigerated lorry in western Senegal.
Local media said at the time that the truck was hauling fish to Dakar.

Burkina Faso: Ten people killed by road mine in eastern border town
                                                      Burkina Faso
                                                                                    -  
At least 10 people were killed when their minibus hit a roadside bomb in eastern Burkina Faso on Christmas Day in a suspected Islamic extremist attack.
The minibus was travelling near the village of Bougui and close to the border with Niger on Sunday afternoon when it hit a landmine, Colonel Hubert Yameogo said in a statement.
While the injured were taken to the hospital in Fada N'Gourma, the main town in the east, the rest of the passengers on the bus disappeared, Colonel Yameogo said.
A resident of Fada N'Gourma who visited people in the hospital on Sunday said that some of the severely injured had died and that everyone was terrified.
The government is trying to restore security to the area and locate the missing passengers.
Violence linked to Al Qaeda and the Islamic State group has wracked the country for more than six years, killing thousands and displacing nearly 2 million people.
The government's inability to stem the attacks led to two coups this year, with each junta leader vowing to make security a priority.
However, attacks are continuing and large areas of land are being cut off by jihadis.
The east and the Sahel regions have been some of the hardest-hit parts of the country, with towns becoming besieged by jihadis who prevent civilians from moving freely.
Sunday's attack came one day after another mine exploded in the east, between Ougarou and Matiacoali villages, injuring five soldiers, according to an internal security report for aid groups seen by The Associated Press. The mine was targeting a unit near a mining site, the report said.

                                                      Launch of works to build Madagascar's first motorway
                                                                                    -  
Authorities in Madagascar have started works on the country's first motorway linking the capital, Antananarivo, to Tamatave, the country's economic hub and largest port.
Egyptian company Samcrete will be in charge of the 4-year project for a budget of nearly $1 billion.
"The highway will allow us to relieve the congestion of the national road number 2 because in fact it is estimated that the traffic will be multiplied by 5 in the next three years. So it will be unbearable for the national road number 2 to handle this extra traffic", said Public Works Minister of Madagascar, Jerry Hatrefindrazana.
The project has sparked controversy amongst the population. Farmers are one group particularly affected.
"We are in the middle of the rice transplanting period, right at the moment when our rice fields will be destroyed. And we have been waiting for the state to take action for us farmers. In all the speeches, no official spoke about the farmers", complained farmer Roland Edie Rakotodramasy.
Others, like teacher Pauline Ramialisoa, remain convinced about the overall benefits.
"Traffic will be faster, cars will not use much gasoline, and the transport of goods from inside and outside will be more fluid", she said
One of the Egyptian companies involved in the project, EGAAD, stressed the environmental advantages of the new infrastructure.
"This highway that will link the capital to the main port, the economic hub of the country, will ease a lot of things, reducing an 11-hour journey to a 2.5-hour journey. It will help to reduce CO2 emissions by 25 to 30%", claims EGAAD group president, Reda Boulos.
The first stage of the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the president's mandate in 2023.

**The incident occurred during the night from Wednesday to Thursday. The bridge was on the road connecting the towns of Kaya and Dori, one of the main routes between the capital and the north of the country. Burkina battles jihadists who spread terror among civilians and block access to key axis.**  
In Burkina Faso's capital long lines of cars and bus have appeared. Those wishing to travel to Ouagadougou or leave via the Nare bridge are stuck for long hours. During the night from Wednesday to Thursday, gunmen blew up a bridge on the road connecting the towns of Kaya and Dori, one of the main routes between the capital and the north of the country. 
A nightmare for minibus drivers like Moumini Sawadogo: "For those who wanted to leave Ouagadougou, Kaya, other parts of the country, to reach Dori, in order to work, for them everything has stopped. Even goods cannot circulate. There are people who left Dori to come here, to buy goods to sell them, but all has stopped for them too. "It's impossible to go to Dori because of the bridge. We heard that unidentified armed men destroyed it, so it's impossible to go to Dori because of the bridge."
A security source said Thursday that the blast hit a bridge on the road connecting the towns of Kaya and Dori, adding forces had been deployed to the area. It comes as Burkina Faso battles a deadly jihadist insurgency that has seen extremists spread terror among civilians and block access to several axis and towns in the north and east of the country. Earlier this month, West Africa's mediator for the country said the Burkinabe authorities only control 60 percent of the country.

Ethiopia’s Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, who is in Beijing to attend the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, held talks on Monday with China’s Premier Li Qiang.
Li said China was willing to work with Ethiopia to support each other in maintaining domestic stability and achieving development and revitalization.
He said Beijing was willing to further expand cooperation with Addis Ababa in economy, trade, and other fields, so as to bring the two countries' interests closer together.
Ahmed, meanwhile, described China as Ethiopia’s most trustworthy partner and friend, saying he appreciated Beijing's long-time strong support for his country's economic and social development.
He said Ethiopia was willing to take part actively in building China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and deepen cooperation in several fields, including industry and agriculture.
After the talks, Li and Ahmed witnessed the signing of bilateral cooperation documents including those under the Belt and Road Initiative.
The conference marks the 10th anniversary of the BRI, a plan for global infrastructure and energy networks launched by China purportedly to boost global trade.
But some see it as a tool for Beijing to spread its geopolitical and economic influence.

                                                      Kenyan President William Ruto will ask China for a $1 billion loan to complete stalled road projects.
                                                                                    -  
Kenyan President William Ruto will ask China for a $1 billion loan to complete stalled road projects when he travels to Beijing later this month, his deputy Rigathi Gachahua said Friday.
Speaking on local radio Inooro FM, Gachahua said that Ruto will also ask for a longer repayment period for the money that is already owed. 
Ruto's plan is a marked shift in his stance, after his coalition previously criticised his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta's borrowing spree from China.
Unpaid billsKenyatta used the Chinese loans to fund infrastructure projects, such as the Nairobi expressway, but many of these projects have since stalled as contractors abandon them due to unpaid bills. 
"If we get $1 billion we can be able to give these people [contractors] the money they are owed so they can return so even as we pay the debt, the roads are completed," Gachahua said.
The deputy said Ruto will ask Chinese officials if Kenya can be given more time to repay the debts. 
Belt and Road InitiativeKenya was one of many countries on the continent that were a focus of China's Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious project launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping to extend Chinese geopolitical and economic influence through a global infrastructure development push. 
But the surge in Chinese loans to countries like Kenya, before a slowdown in Chinese lending from 2019, has angered critics, pushed up debt loads and the subsequent repayment burden.
The Kenyan government is spending roughly half of its revenue to repay debts that are falling due, official data shows, straining its finances. The situation has been compounded by foreign debt repayments, amid a steep weakening of the Kenyan currency.
The cabinet ordered all ministries to cut 10% of their budget on Tuesday, while the president's office imposed some restrictions on foreign travel by government officials to rein in expenditure.
"It is true that many people have been travelling abroad, spending a lot of money, and that is why the president ordered that even ministers and governors can only travel with two people," Gachagua said.

The heavy load of copper cathodes is secured, the Howo semi-trailer is ready to travel the 2,000 km or so from the mines in Haut-Katanga to the port of Dar es Salaam, from where the cargo will be shipped to Asia.
"It can take two weeks to make the trip," complains Omar Rachidi Katema, a 57-year-old Tanzanian truck driver who has just loaded 27 tons of copper plate at the Chemaf (Chemicals of Africa) plant at the Etoile mine site in Lubumbashi, in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
"There are a lot of traffic jams, a lot of tolls, a lot of waiting at the border," says the trucker.
The plates (cathodes) are firmly attached in bundles, each weighing 2.3 tons. "To avoid theft" during transport, explains Eric Tshinkobo, copper manager at the plant.
At the London Metal Exchange (LME) price, a ton of copper costs about $10,000.
But if the goods are spared, the drivers are not, especially on the Congolese portion of the route. "Thieves attack us, especially on the Lubumbashi bypass road," says Omar Rachidi.
"Between here and the Zambian border (about 80 km), bandits attack us, rip off the tarpaulins, take away our money," also laments Jacob Daoudi, 45, another Tanzanian trucker, who transports 30 tons of cobalt hydroxide in his Scania.
To avoid drivers carrying too much cash, operators are increasingly resorting to prepayment, via a bank, of the substantial sums to be paid at the toll booths along the road from Kolwezi, another major mining town in neighbouring Lualaba province, to Kasumbalesa, on the border with Zambia.
There are six toll booths along the 400 km of this strategic route," said Lambert Tshisueka Mutondo, president of the international road transporters of Haut-Katanga, affiliated with the Federation of Congolese Companies (FEC). This situation "hinders the flow of traffic and the profitability of the sector", he says.
He also deplores the tariffs charged: to cover these 400 km, heavy goods vehicles pay some 500 dollars, or 1,000 dollars round trip, ten times more expensive on average, according to him, than on the roads of southern Africa.
The tolls on this section are conceded by the Congolese state to a Chinese company which, in return, undertakes to ensure the construction and maintenance of road infrastructure.
The issue is sensitive and regularly debated, with one NGO recently denouncing the "leonine" nature of this type of contract. The Congolese Association for Access to Justice (Acaj) was surprised that after 14 years of concessions, the DRC still does not have a highway.
The government firmly disputes this analysis and asserts that these concessions, which it wants to extend, have enabled the construction and rehabilitation of many roads.
Compared to the average state of the Congolese road network, National Road 1, which crosses "greater Katanga", is good, paved and without deep potholes. But it has only two lanes, one for each direction of traffic.
Upstream of the Kanyaka tollbooth, halfway between Lubumbashi and the border, more than 200 semi-trailers are at a standstill, waiting to complete the mandatory formalities.
"In the Congo, there are red tape all the time," says Maniasi Djuma Makweba, 50, also on his way to Dar es Salaam with 35 tons of cobalt loaded at TFM (Tenke Fungurume Mining), 300 km away.
Like the other drivers, he complains about thieves, but also about the military and police. "When you go to the police to report a theft, they start by trying to extort money from you," the trucker says.
The Upper Katanga transporters' guild is calling for "patrols to deter criminals", as well as for the number of toll booths to be halved, for prices to be "capped according to the distance to be covered" and "harmonized" between the DRC and neighboring Zambia.
In fact, "by reciprocity", Zambia makes Congolese trucks pay a high price when crossing its territory and thus loses all competitiveness to South African, Zimbabwean or Tanzanian transporters. "For several years, international transport in our province has been the prerogative of foreign companies," deplores its president.
The DRC is the world's largest producer of cobalt and Africa's largest producer of copper.

Rabat has concluded three loan contracts totaling 250 million euros, as well as two grant contracts worth 7 million euros with the German Development Bank. They concern financing relating to social protection, sustainable mobility, and irrigation.
Improving the living conditions of the population via a program to support the social protection project, it is around this axis that a first subsidized loan of 120 million euros, accompanied by a donation of 2 million euros has been allocated.
The second concerns the financing of the Fund to support urban and interurban road transport reforms (FART). In this context, the loan amounts to 100 million euros, backed by a donation of 5 million euros.
It will be used to promote and finance the development of a modern and climate-friendly public transport offer in Moroccan cities and towns.
The third financing, amounting to 30 million euros in the form of a loan, is dedicated to the project “Improving the efficiency of water consumption in irrigated agriculture (Sidi Mohamed Cherif Perimeter)”.
It will contribute to the valorization and efficient use of regulated irrigation water downstream of the Ouljet Essoltane dam.

Algeria partners China for construction of 6,000km railway lines

                                                                                    -  
China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the "best guarantee of development", stressing that "our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km." The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
"China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner," said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
"The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth," he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
"As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities," said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
"This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone," echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

Rwanda is investing heavily in sports through partnerships with clubs such as Arsenal and PSG and the organization of the World Road Cycling Championships in 2025. However this strategy has drawn criticism from the opposition, which doubts it is usefull for the economy of the 73rd FIFA Congress host country.
First, it was a multi-million dollar sponsorship of English Premier League club Arsenal in 2018, followed by a splashy deal to back French giants Paris Saint-Germain a year later. The "Visit Rwanda" can now be seen on Premier League and Ligue 1 pitches.
The vision of Rwandan authorities takes shape with club sponsorships and hosting duties for events ranging from 2021’s Basketball Africa league tournament to cycling’s Road World Championships in 2025.
It has required extensive work to provide the country with new sports infrastructure: $104 million for a 10,000-seat basketball hall, $16 million for a golf course inaugurated in 2021 in Kigali, and $165 million budgeted for the ongoing construction of the National Stadium, which is expected to expand from 25,000 to 45,000 seats by 2024.
President Paul Kagame has spent a small fortune on sports investments that he says will burnish the international image and diversify the economy of the tiny eastern African country.
But the splurge has drawn accusations of “sports-washing”. Campaigners accuse Kagame of crushing political dissent and stifling free speech during his more than 22 years in power.
Improve standard of living"These investments do not meet the immediate needs of the vast majority of Rwandans," said opposition politician Victoire Ingabire, a fierce critic of Kagame.
"I don’t believe there is return for his investments," she told AFP, saying that the sponsorships did little to help rural Rwandans. "It is wasted money."
In the eastern African ccountry, per capita income is estimated at just $822 according to 2021 World Bank figures.
Government officials have defended the projects, arguing that they serve to bolster the country’s reputation as a safe destination for high-profile events.
Pre-pandemic tourism revenues jumped 17 percent to $498 million in 2019, according to Rwanda Development Board.
The board’s CEO, Clare Akamanzi, said at the weekend that the Arsenal and PSG sponsorship deals alone had generated over $160 million in media value. This had in turn brought one million visitors to Rwanda, injecting $445 million in tourism revenues, she added.
"These guests not only left Rwanda with positive memories; they also played a direct role in improving peoples’ lives," she wrote in an opinion piece published Saturday in the East African newspaper.
Fearless"It’s alright to disagree with Rwanda’s governance model, but a campaign to undermine investment in a developing country’s economy, which has a real impact on the lives (of) people, is counterproductive and cynical," she adde.
For Kagame — an ardent Arsenal supporter — the deals had surpassed "by far what we invested", he said this month, adding that the government was on the verge of sponsoring a third team.
And world football’s governing body FIFA will be in town this week for its 73rd congress to reelect its chief Gianni Infantino who is running unopposed.
Authorities say such events bring in much-needed foreign exchange and provide an economic boost to the landlocked nation which is reliant on tourism.
Ruling party MP John-Ruku Rwabyoma echoed her sentiments in an interview with AFP, charging that critics of the deal were "ignorant" and that the government was acting in the best interest of its people.
"We are not here to satisfy critics based on their agenda. Where were all these critics when Rwanda was suffering?"
A foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity told AFP he was skeptical about the claims.
"I don’t know whether it is cost-effective… whether it is paying off in the long run, maybe then, but now, I do not think so," he said, adding that he had not seen the numbers to support the government’s narrative.
Nonetheless, doubts raised by "pundits who mostly know next to nothing about Rwanda, and draw upon tired tropes" will do little to stop the initiatives, according to Clare Akamanzi.
"We will not be bullied into ceding our place at the table," she said.

Corruption inflated costs of high-profile projects in Zambia - IMF

                                                                                    -  
The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday (Jan. 10) that corruption had inflated the cost of numerous high-profile tenders and infrastructure projects in Zambia.
At the request of local authorities, an IMF interdepartmental Governance Diagnostic Assessment mission conducted last year a study focused on governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities.
The assessment revealed serious weakness across all state functions. However, those with particular macroeconomic impact were found in areas including public financial management, granting and managing contracts in the mining sector.
"For instance, enormous financial resources invested in infrastructure projects, such as road construction, provided avenues for corruption, especially in the award of tenders, where political connections allowed members of the elite to bend the rules and access to lucrative contracts", the 96-page report read.
The IMF diagnostic says corruption became particularly institutionalized during 2016-2021 period.
Zambia's current leader vowed, upon his election two years ago, to show "zero tolerance" for graft.
Hakainde Hichilema's first targets were members of the government of his predecessor.
Many arrests however ended in bail, with defendants denying the charges.

Ivory Coast on Monday commissioned the construction of two major infrastructure projects in the Ivorian economic capital Abidjan- that of a metro and the extension of the international airport. The launch of the construction was attended by the French Economy Minister Bruno le Maire who signed agreements  including credit, for this project.
"The purpose of my visit is obviously to mark the concrete launch of the completion of major infrastructure projects here in Abidjan. " Le Maire said in Abidjan.
"The metro is one of the largest infrastructure projects on the continent. It is an ambitious project, a social project that will benefit millions of people in Abidjan" the French minister added.
At the end of 2019, a French consortium comprising the groups Bouygues Travaux Publics, Alstom, Colas Rail and Keolis had been chosen to build the first metro line in Abidjan.
At the time, France committed to cover the contract with a mix of loans from the French Treasury and private financing guaranteed by the French government. The cost of the work is estimated at 1.36 billion euros. The line will cross the Ivorian metropolis from north to south over 37 km, as far as the airport. The construction work has been delayed for years, but the government hopes that the metro will be operational by 2025.

                                                      Nigeria's first deep sea port in Lekki, Nigeria
                                                                                    -  
The China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) on Monday handed over Nigeria's first deep sea port to the government after the completion of the huge maritime project in the country's economic hub city of Lagos. 
The completion ceremony of Lekki port which took place at the Lekki Area Site in Lagos State brought together dignitaries and stakeholders from Nigeria and China as well as their international partners. 
In his address, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwolu expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government for its support of Nigeria's infrastructure, and praised Chinese enterprises for completing the project construction efficiently and on schedule. 
"The benefit of this project and the benefits to our citizens can be left better imagined, providing jobs for close to 200,000 people with direct and indirect jobs in the next couple of months ahead. 
In addition, we can see the figure adding tens of billions in dollar revenue to our country and to our state and to the host community in taxes and revenue," said Babajide Sanwo-Olu, state governor of Lagos.
 Constructed by the CHEC, the Lekki Deep Sea Port is the largest seaport in Nigeria, and one of the biggest in West Africa. The construction of the port commenced in June 2020, and is designed to handle 1.2 million standard containers annually. 
As a commercial project of tripartite cooperation between China, France and Nigeria, Lekki port is of great significance for promoting Belt and Road cooperation in Africa, said the ambassador. 
"The French side has their experience, shipping routes and cargo volume, then our Chinese side has the construction, use, and maintenance of this port, plus Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa. We are very optimistic," said Wu Di, deputy general manager of China Harbor Engineering Company. 
China's Ambassador to Nigeria Cui Jianchun said Lekki port and the Lekki Free Trade Zone could work together to spur economic development. 
"This is very, very important for Lagos State and also it is very important that I categorize here the deep sea port as a gateway for Nigeria. So Nigeria now through this maritime road can build with the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. I think that is very, very critical for Nigerian commodities to go to the international market," said Cui. The new port has two container berths, which can berth the world's largest Panamax cargo ship.

Malawi’s President Lazarus Chakwera and theUnited States Secretary of State Antony Blinken presided over the signing of a Millennium Challenge Corporation compact (MCC) worth US$350 million, on Wednesday.
The Malawian Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Sosten Gwengwe and MCC CEO Alice Albright inked the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) MOU (Memorandum of Understanding).
The aid through the MCC, which assists developing nations meeting democratic benchmarks, will fund a major road network to connect rural and urban areas in Malawi.
"Safe and reliable rail and road transport investments will certainly help reduce barriers to growth and create opportunities for all of our people," Chakwera said.
The Biden administration says through the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), the U.S. government and the Government of Malawi will include the $245 million Accelerated Growth Corridors Project.
The project "sets out an ambitious agenda to reduce transport costs and better connect goods, farms, and rural populations to markets."
The compact's Accelerated Growth Corridors Project will invest in Malawi's transportation sector, including road updates in four selected corridors located in strategic agricultural areas.
In Washington, President Chakwera called on the US to consider a project that would include Zambia and Mozambique and give Malawi reliable access to the Indian Ocean.
Blinken said the Malawi project would also address a key US priority by trying to reduce gender-based violence by making it safer for women to bring goods to markets.
