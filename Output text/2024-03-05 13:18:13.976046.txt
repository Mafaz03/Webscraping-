Minister urges Tema Motorway Roundabout contractors to complete project ahead of schedule
Accra, Feb. 29, GNA – Mr Francis Asenso-Boakye, Minister of Roads and Highway, has urged contractors working on the Tema Motorway Roundabout Project- Phase Two to complete the project ahead of schedule.
The Minster said just as the Phase One of the project was completed ahead of schedule, he wanted the second phase to also be completed earlier to bring relief to commuters.
Mr Asenso-Boakye said this during a tour of the project site at the Tema Motorway along with officials from his Ministry and the Ghana Highway Authority.
The contractors, JFE Engineering Corporation, planed to complete the project by December 2024; however, the Minister impressed on them to speed it up to the closing weeks of October 2024.
The project dubbed: “The Project for the Improvement of Tema Motorway Roundabout Phase II” commenced on July 15, 2022 and consists of the construction of a recommended third-tier flyover of the Tema Harbour – Akosombo stretch.
The project stretches from the Total Fuel Station at Tema Community Nine towards the Ashaiman Timber Market on the Tema – Akosombo road.
The project, being funded with a Japanese grant of $27 million, is expected to provide an anchor for the continuous expansion of the 64 – kilometer Tema – Akosombo stretch.
The Minister admonished the contractors to employ a day and night-around the clock operations and add more staff if necessary to speed up the project completions.
Mr Asenso-Boakye said the full complement of the project when completed would ease the intense traffic in the area and improve free vehicular flow from Tema and other adjourning communities.
He added the project would serve both domestic and international traveling needs and improve the flow of movement from the Tema Harbour to Accra and the ECOWAS subregion as whole.
Mr Satoshi Yamamoto, Project Manager, Tema Roundabout Project- Phase Two, said the project was at 60 per cent complete.
He said work was almost done with the project’s piers and abatement, which would provide structural support to the overall project.
Mr Yamamoto said the project would make it easier for the Tema Harbour to clear goods quickly, end traffic jam and improve trade integration and economic growth in the ECOWAS subregion.
The first phase of the project, funded with Japanese grant of $55.6 million, commenced on July 27, 2018 and was completed on April 2020.

Ex- Assembly member in court for not constructing funded road project | Ghana News Agency

Ex- Assembly member in court for not constructing funded road project
Accra, Feb. 27, GNA- Nii Armah Ashitey a former Assembly member, who was allegedly given GHC500,000 by a foundation to construct road and drainage but failed has appeared before an Accra Circuit Court.
Ashitey. a former assembly member for Adobetor electoral area in La Dadekotpon Municipality, has been charged with defrauding by false pretences, using public office for profit, money laundering.
The 63-year-old former assembly member has pleaded not guilty to the various charges.
Ashiety is said to have told the Police that he used the money for “mobilization of the project” but could not provide documents and receipts to that effect.
The court presided over by Mr Isaac Addo has admitted Ashitey to bail in the sum of GHC500,000 with two sureties.
Prosecution led by Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Seth Frimpong said the complainants, Maxwell Ahugah and Mrs Naomi Vogel were manager and director, respectively of Robert Vogel Memorial Foundation.
ASP Frimpong said the accused person was a resident of La Wireless.
Prosecution said somewhere in the month of May 2018, Robert Vogel Foundation Memorial, a non-profit organization, engaged in philanthropic activities within the Community, decided to construct a road and drainage as part of their community development at Adobetor electoral area.
According to prosecution, the construction of the projects took place during Ashitey’s tenure as an assembly member of La Dadekotopon Municipal Assembly.
The prosecutor said Ashitey was approached by the Director and Manager of the Robert Vogel Memorial Foundation about their desire to construct a particular road with its attached drainage.
Prosecution said the accused person took advantage of the gesture and presented to the complainants, Bill of Quantities on a number of roads and drains that the assembly had earmarked to construct.
The court heard that Ashitey deceived the Director Mrs Naomi Vogel of the said Foundation to transfer GHC500,000 into his personal account with La Community Bank which he presented as the Municipal Assembly ‘s account.
Again, prosecution said the accused person “deceived the foundation manager and director into believing that the construction of the selected road and drains at Adobetor area had been done with the funds from the Foundation.
Prosecution said the accused person, however, failed to undertake the construction which he claimed he had the capacity to undertake.
The prosecutor said on April 11, 2023, Ashitey was arrested and during interrogation, he told the Police that he “used all the GHC500,000 to do mobilization of the project”.
Prosecution said during investigations, the accused person was given the opportunity to furnish the Police with receipts or documents to know how the funds were disbursed for the “mobilization but he could not provide any document or receipts.”
ASP Frimpong said the Police visited the area where the construction should have been done and it was observed that the road had not been constructed and no drainage was done.
“Investigations revealed that accused person simply made this representation which he knew were false to obtain the consent of the manager and the director of the foundation to part with the GHC500,000 and he has since misappropriated the said amount with no effort or ability to construct the road,” prosecution said.
The prosecutor said it was also established that by the accused person’s status as someone who held office as elected assembly member for Adobetor electoral area, he was a public officer.

Agric Minister cuts sod for construction of farm infrastructure projects  
Accra, Feb 20, GNA — Dr. Bryan Acheampong, Minister of Food and Agriculture, has cut the sod for the construction of farm infrastructure for smallholder farmers in Kwasi Fante, Afram Plains South District, Eastern Region. 
The project, which is under the Emergency Support to Rural Livelihoods and Food Systems exposed to COVID-19 (ESRF), includes the construction of farm tracks (roads), water harvesting schemes, drying platforms, and boreholes.  
It aims to enhance the lives of smallholder farmers by providing better access to markets, addressing water scarcity, increasing crop yields, and improving post-harvest management.  
It is supported by the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD). 
Speaking at the sod-cutting ceremony over the weekend, Dr Acheampong said building robust agriculture infrastructure was critical to improving farm yields and achieving food security for the country. 
In that regard, he said, the government was embarking on a massive infrastructure development in the agriculture sector, disclosing that, about 100-hectare water harvesting schemes would be constructed for smallholder farmers in Tordzinu, South Tongu District, and Klenormadi, Ketu District, in the Volta Region.  
Additionally, he said, 16 commodity drying platforms would be built, and 29.5 kilometres of farm tracks would be constructed in various regions. 
“Furthermore, 20 boreholes will be installed in the North-East Gonja, Nanton, Atebubu, Bono East, Northern, and Savannah regions,” he added. 
Dr Acheampong said the projects, when completed, would impact smallholder farmers and beneficiary communities, stating that they would be better equipped to face challenges posed by climate change.  
The Minister urged contractors undertaking the projects to adhere to the highest construction standards and avoid shoddy work to ensure that the projects lasted a lifetime 
He thanked IFAD for its assistance in making the projects feasible and called for collective action to transform the agricultural sector and contribute to Ghana’s economic growth. 
Dr Hayford Baah-Adade, the Programme Coordinator for ESRF, said that the projects would support smallholder farmers and beneficiary communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.  
He said that the initiative aimed to achieve three key goals: protect against hunger and build resilient livelihoods; safeguard rural marketing linkages and food security; and project management, monitoring, and evaluation. 
He assured the Minister of delivering quality work, indicating that the contractors had been selected based on their expertise and successful track records in executing such infrastructure projects.  
Dr. Baah-Adade urged supervising agencies, such as the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), the Department of Feeder Roads (DFR), and the Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA), to be accountable for providing effective supervision and monitoring project progress to ensure quality and timely delivery of projects.

Work on Ofankor-Nsawam Road Project 50 per cent complete — Resident Engineer 
Accra, Feb 10, GNA — Construction work on the 33.4km Ofankor-Nsawam Road Project is about 50 per cent complete and will be done as scheduled, Mr Kwabena Bempong, the Chief Resident Engineer for the project, has said.  
Work on the stretch, which forms part of the Accra-Kumasi road network, commenced in 2022 and expected to last for two years, ending in July 2024. 
The stretch serves as a major arterial road for communities in the Ga West Municipal Assembly, Pokuase, Amasaman, Medie, and Sarpeiman, among others. 
It also serves as a vital link for trade between Ghana and its neighbouring landlocked countries – Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, and for transit cargo to move from the country’s ports to those destinations. 
Mr Bempong, addressing the Minister of Roads and Highways, Mr Kwasi Amoako-Atta, during an inspection tour, said work on the project was progressing as expected with the contractor on course to deliver the project on time. 
“Presently, our progress is about 50 per cent and we are hoping that by the end of the year, we would have gone substantially complete,” he said. 
Giving details of work done so far, the Chief Resident Engineer said  a lot of concrete works were done, indicating that construction of foot bridges were about 50 per cent complete. 
Additionally, he said they were in the process of completing the two overpasses and an underpass at Medie, Pobiman, Amasaman, adding that, construction work on the three-tier interchange at Nsawam was 20 per cent complete.  
“Nsawam is where we have the three-tier interchange, we are currently about 20 per cent complete, with the Pobiman, we’ve done about 70 per cent, Medie is also about 40 per cent and then the railway bridge, that is not an interchange but then, that is also about 50 per cent complete,” he indicated.  
Again, Mr Bempong indicated that all cross culverts were almost complete while 40 per cent of all longitudinal drains had been completed. 
With regards to relocation of utility lines, the Resident Engineer said with the exception of the high tensions, which would be removed in the coming days, all electrical pillions had been relocated.  
“With regards to the water lines, that also has started. The first 2km, they have done quite substantial work and then, wherever we have emergency situations we have done work,” he added.  
Funded by the Government at an estimated cost of GH¢342.48, the Ofankor-Nsawam road when completed would have three lanes, service roads, one interchange, two overpasses and an underpass. 
The construction is being undertaken by Maripoma Enterprise Limited, a local construction firm. 
Mr Amoako-Atta, the Minister of Roads and Highways, expressed contentment with the progress of work so far, indicating that Government would ensure that quality work was done.  
While urging the Contractor to take all measures to reduce the dust emanating as a result of the construction work, he  appealed to motorists and residents to bare with the Contractor, be cautious and reduce speed on the stretch to ensure the safety of all.  
The Minister also toured the Flowerpot Flyover which is 70 per cent complete and the yet to commence dualisation of Adentan-Dodowa Road.  
He was accompained by some engineers from the Ministry and the Ghana Highways Authority (GHA), including Mr Stephen Jalulah, Deputy Minister of Roads; Mr Abass Awolu, Chief Director of the Ministry; Mr Collins Donkor, Acting Chief Executive, GHA; Mr Samuel Akuaku, Acting Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Administration, GHA; and Mr Lawrence Lamptey, a Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Maintenance, GHA.

Mr Amoako-Atta, the Minister of Roads and Highways, expressed contentment with the progress of work so far, indicating that Government would ensure that quality work was done.  
While urging the Contractor to take all measures to reduce the dust emanating as a result of the construction work, he  appealed to motorists and residents to bare with the Contractor, be cautious and reduce speed on the stretch to ensure the safety of all.  
The Minister also toured the Flowerpot Flyover which is 70 per cent complete and the yet to commence dualisation of Adentan-Dodowa Road.  
He was accompained by some engineers from the Ministry and the Ghana Highways Authority (GHA), including Mr Stephen Jalulah, Deputy Minister of Roads; Mr Abass Awolu, Chief Director of the Ministry; Mr Collins Donkor, Acting Chief Executive, GHA; Mr Samuel Akuaku, Acting Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Administration, GHA; and Mr Lawrence Lamptey, a Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Maintenance, GHA.

Ofankor-Nsawam Road: Let’s exercise patience to ensure safety of all— Roads Minister cautions drivers 
Accra, Feb 10, GNA — Mr Kwasi Amoako-Atta, the Minister of Roads and Highways, has asked drivers who ply the Ofankor-Nsawam road to exercise some level of patience and caution to ensure the safety of all. 
The Minister’s call follows an accident that occurred on Monday, February 5, 2024, around China Mall, which claimed more than seven lives. 
Speaking to the media after inspecting work on the road, on Friday, Mr Amoako-Atta described the accident as a “needless” one, which could have been averted had the drivers of the vehicles involved exercised a little bit of patience. 
“I’m saddened by the accident that happened on Monday, about a week ago, on this stretch of the road that led to the loss of I think seven or more lives,” he said.  
“When I visited the accident scene, well, accident is an accident, but on my own and as a layman and from what I saw, the accident was perhaps needless in the sense that it happened on even asphaltic section of the road, a straight road and there is so much clearance that under normal circumstance, and knowing that this stretch of road is under construction, that everybody should be a bit cautious and reduce speed, I couldn’t understand why that reported accident should happen,” he added.  
The Minister urged motorists to value their lives and that of others and take extreme caution to help protect life and property.  
“I think all of us should take our destiny into our hands and we should be careful so that we don’t die unnecessarily,” Mr Amoako-Atta urged.  
The Ofankor-Nsawam section of the National Route Six (N6) serves as a major arterial road for communities in the Ga West Municipal Assembly, Pokuase, Amasaman, Medie, and Sarpeiman, among others. 
It also serves as a vital link for trade between Ghana and its neighbouring landlocked countries – Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, and for transit cargo to move from the country’s ports to those destinations. 
Rehabilitation work on the 33.4km stretch, which also forms part of the Accra-Kumasi road network, commenced in 2022, and expected to last for two years, ending in July 2024. 
It is funded by the Government at a cost of GH¢342.48 and being constructed by Maripoma Enterprise Limited, a local construction firm. 
The Minister was accompanied by some engineers from the Ministry and the Ghana Highways Authority (GHA), including Mr Stephen Jalulah, Deputy Minister of Roads; Mr Abass Awolu, Chief Director of the Ministry; Mr Collins Donkor, Acting Chief Executive, GHA; Mr Samuel Akuaku, Acting Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Administration, GHA; Mr Lawrence Lamptey, a Deputy Chief Executive in charge of Maintenance, GHA.  
Mr Amoako-Atta, while extending the Government’s condolences to affected families, he assured that, it would ensure that all construction sites adhered to standard safety to prevent such occurrences.  
Mr Kwabena Bempong, Chief Resident Engineer for the Ofankor-Nsawam Road Project, said the Contractor had put in place a number of safety measures, including regular watering of the road to reduce the dust and enhance visibility. 
To ensure that, he said it had increased its water tankers from the previous 10 to 16 to fast-track the process.  
Mr Bempong called on the Road Safety Authority to move in and help tow all broken down long vehicles by the sides of the road, which were impeding free vehicular movements to avert any unforeseen circumstances.  
He also assured motorists who plied the stretch and residents of the area that the project would be completed as scheduled to alleviate their plights.  
Currently, a two-lane dual carriageway road, the Ofankor-Nsawam Road Project, when completed would be three lanes, service roads, one interchange and two overpasses and one underpass.  
Mr Bempong said, “presently, our progress is about 50 per cent and we are hoping that by the end of the year, we would have gone substantially complete.” 
The Minister also toured some road projects in the Greater Accra Region such as the Flowerpot Flyover and the yet to commence Adentan-Dodowa Road Project.

Afienya residents express frustration over poor road condition
Afienya (GAR), Jan. 30, GNA- Residents of Afienya-New Jerusalem in the Ningo-Prampram District of the Greater Accra Region have expressed frustration and anger about the current poor state of the road network in the area.
The untarred road network is dusty and full of deep trenches, making it un-motorable and muddy, especially when it rains.
Mr John Adjei, a resident of the area, told the Ghana News Agency (GNA) in an interview that although the road had deteriorated over the years, the heavy tipper trucks plying it frequently kept worsening the situation.
He stated that despite the numerous complaints made to the Ningo-Prampram District Assembly, residents were yet to see any significant action taken to address the situation.
Madam Mary Awuni, another resident operating a provision shop along the road, said apart from the difficult navigation challenges, she had to always deal with the heavy dust deposits on her wares and sometime incur losses during the rainy seasons due to flooding in the area.
Mr Kwesi Asiedu, a taxi driver, also said drivers must constantly change their vehicle parts due to the nature of the road.

Trailer carrying 600 bags of salt dismantles Sayikope bridge, plunges into river
Sayikope (V/R), Jan. 26, GNA – A trailer carrying some 600 bags of salt has collapsed the steel bridge at Sayikope and plunged into the Aklakpa River, causing commuters from Juapong, Adidome and Accra to be stranded.
The trailer, at the time of the accident weighs about 255 tonnes with its cargo, ignoring the signage of 25 tonnes, which is erected some metres to the bridge.
The incident, which occurred at about 2200 hours on Thursday, recorded no casualties after swift intervention of some of the residents.
Mr Osborn Fenu, the District Chief Executive for North Tongu disclosed that the ill-fated bridge was designed to withstand a maximum weight of 25 tonnes, a mere fraction of the load the vehicle was carrying.
He lamented that most drivers disregard the weight restrictions on local bridges in the district and emphasized the need for adherence to safety regulations.
Mr. Fenu, however, gave the assurance that the district’s engineering team were working tirelessly with the Regional Highways Authority to reconstruct a new bridge for the continuation of socio-economic activities.
Mr Ebenezer Adegah, the North Tongu District Engineer indicated that the Sayikope Bridge was weak and needed urgent reconstruction after his team had an intensive check on it a few months ago.
He said that the attention of the Bridges Engineering Department of the Ghana Highways Authority and the Volta River Authority (VRA) were drawn to the situation, and they were ready to fund the reconstruction of the bridge prior to its recent collapse.
Mr. Adegah stated that, “the police were contacted, and I hope that the driver will be engaged in further questioning for other legal actions to be taken.”
He said that awareness would be created to stop drivers and other commuters from using that route to avert any casualty.
The driver of the trailer (name unavailable) is said to be helping the Police to investigate the accident.

Cocoa smuggling in Oti affecting revenue, development- Minister | Ghana News Agency

Cocoa smuggling in Oti affecting revenue, development- Minister
Likpe (O/R), Jan. 26, GNA – Mr Joshua G. Makubu, Oti Regional Minister, has revealed that the menace of cocoa smuggling in the Oti region was not only affecting revenue generation but also development such as cocoa roads.
He said in 2019, the region used to produce about 8,000 tonnes of cocoa but “as we speak the Oti region is struggling to even be able to make 100 tonnes”.
Mr Makubu said the decrease in production was not because the trees were not yielding but whatever cocoa produced was smuggled out of the country which was affecting revenue and development including the cocoa roads.
The Regional Minister made the observation at a Ghana Boundary Commission community engagement at Likpe, in the Guan District of the Oti Region.
He said: “Each time you are taking cocoa across the boundaries of Ghana, and you see any road untarred under the cocoa road project, you should know that we have done it for ourselves and not that government is not interested”.
He urged traditional leaders to talk to their subjects to see that the menace was stopped to build the nation and enjoy it.
Dr Makubu said he would meet the Regional Manager of the COCOBOD and get to know all the local buying points and find out if they had sufficient funds to be able to buy adding that if that was assured, the Regional Security Council would also ensure that they police the system and unapproved routes to apprehend the culprits.
He said the Region’s contribution to the national cocoa stock was affecting how much revenue the country made from the sale of cocoa and for that matter their roads since COCOBOD was not in the position to be able to continue the various cocoa road projects.
Mr Makubu said some cocoa roads had been abandoned in the Guan District as well as in Nkwanta including the road from Breweniase through Pusupu to Bontibor and linking up to the main Nkwanta road.
He said there had been some level of progress with the help of the National Security to curb the menace, but it was unsatisfactory and would continue to work with them and community leaders to ensure that the Region returned to its past glory of contributing not less than 9,000 tonnes to the country’s cocoa stock.

PIAC begins oil-funded project inspections for 2024  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Accra, Jan 21, GNA – The Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) has begun the year with the inspection of public infrastructure projects funded with petroleum revenues. 
The committee undertook a simultaneous inspection in the Greater Accra and Central Regions based on information provided by the Ministry of Finance on projects and the accompanying disbursements of petroleum revenues through the Annual Budget Funding Amount (ABFA). 
The exercise was in line with PIAC’s mandate of conducting independent assessment of the management and use of petroleum revenues to ensure maximum impact. 
A PIAC team in Accra was led by the Chair, Emerita Professor Elizabeth Ardayfio-Schandorf and by officials of the Department of Urban Roads of the Ministry of Roads and Highways, and the Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly in some project sites at Teshie and Spintex.  
They were the rehabilitation of selected roads in Teshie Camp, Southern Command and Mats (now Ghana Military Academy), the Construction of the 7.5-kilometre Teshie Link.  Teshie Link, and the Construction of a Flyover over the Tema Motorway from the Flowerpot roundabout.  
These three (3) projects, located in the Ledzokuku Municipality are at different stages of progress and received funds from the ABFA between 2019 and 2022.  
The Team toured the rehabilitated roads, a car park, and a parade ground within the Southern Command in Teshie.  
Information available to PIAC showed that the contract for this project was awarded on July 13, 2020 and was supposed to have been completed within 24 months.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project was 24% physically complete. Out of the total contract sum of GH¢145.82 million, petroleum revenue of GH¢7.39 million, representing 5.07 per cent, was disbursed to the project in 2022.  
The second project inspected by the team was the construction of the 7.5-kilometre Teshie Link.  
It involved the construction of a new road and drainage structures with earthworks and asphaltic concrete surfacing.  
Awarded on 18th October 2019, the project had an original contract duration of 18 months.  
Out of the original contract sum of GH¢87.88 million petroleum revenue of GH¢29.73 million, representing 33.84 per cent was disbursed to the project from 2019 to 2021.  
The PIAC Team was informed that the Teshie Link Road is a dual carriageway that commences in the South on the Accra-Tema coastal road, through the LEKMA Hospital, and terminates on the Spintex Road.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, 95% of all drainage works had been completed, and asphaltic binder and wearing course laid on the road.  
The team was informed that the contractor had suspended work due to non-payment of funds. 
Outstanding works include the installation of traffic signals and road markings to show a controlled intersection.  
The absence of these had resulted in several vehicle crashes in the area.  
The third project was the construction of a flyover over the Tema Motorway, from the Flowerpot roundabout.  
Out of the revised contract sum of GH¢284,665,639.27, a total of GH¢141,093,766.84 representing 49.56 per cent, was disbursed from the ABFA in 2022.  
The project is located at the Flowerpot Roundabout, Spintex and East Legon, and involves creating access from the Motorway to the Boundary Road roundabout and an exit into Cantonments from the Giffard Road Interchange.  
It consists of one mainline bridge, two ramp bridges, four auxiliary roads, and ancillary works. At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project had made physical progress of 70%.  
In the Central Region, the PIAC Team, led by Nana Kweku Dei, a member representing the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College, a 90-bed Hostel Block at Saltpond, and an irrigation infrastructure at Mprumem. 
Accompanied by officials of the Mfantseman Municipal Assembly, the team inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College Project, which had received an amount of GH¢9,507,111.52 from the ABFA from 2012 to 2022.  
The project comprises an 18-Unit Classroom Block, Hostel facility, Administration Block, and a Laboratory.  
Since the Committee’s last visit to the project in 2020, the construction of a teachers’ bungalow has started, and a road contract has been awarded.  
The 4.6km road project, which starts within the campus and ends at the main Accra-Cape Coast highway, is currently at Phase 1 (Sub-base).  
The road contract, originally valued at GH¢8 million has been through three (3) variation orders and is currently valued at approximately GH¢27 million, primarily due to payment delays.  
The Committee also notes that the hostel facility and the 18-unit classroom block had not been fitted with beds and study desks, respectively.  
Also, the laboratory, classroom block and hostel facilities had developed structural defects at the time of PIAC’s inspection. 
In line with the Committee’s policy of visiting projects that have received funding from the ABFA and have been completed, the team inspected a 90-bed Hostel Block for the Ghana Education Service Development Institute (GESDI) at Saltpond.  
The project had received an amount of GH¢1,456,960.92 from the ABFA in 2015. GESDI is a Ghana Education Service (GES) Centre for capacity building in education-related programmes and seminars.  
The project was commissioned in 2020 with a 90-bed capacity hostel block, four (4) washrooms, two conference halls and a 100-person capacity cafeteria.  
The Committee was satisfied with the overall quality of the project.  
Accompanied by the Central Regional Manager of the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), the team inspected a third project, which was the development of an irrigation infrastructure at Mprumem.  
The project received GH¢45.078 million from the ABFA from 2017 to 2020. The irrigation project, which was started in 2015, overlaps the Gomoa Central and Gomoa West Districts.  
It comprises a reservoir area; which stores water from River Bushen for irrigation, and the developed area; which has 70 hectares of irrigable land.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project (now known as the Mprumem Irrigation Scheme) had been completed and was in use by farmers in the vicinity for vegetable farming. 
Across all the projects visited, the issue of delayed payments to contractors was noted. 
The release of funds for the projects to progress uninterruptedly was highlighted by the contractors at the various sites.  
PIAC believes that the co-mingling of petroleum revenues with other funds for projects that end up getting stalled for a long period does not reflect the prudent use of revenues for impact.  
The Committee therefore urged the government to consider channelling adequate petroleum revenues to complete earmarked projects going forward. 
After the inspection in Accra, the Chair of the Committee expressed concern about the paltry sums of petroleum revenues allocated to some ongoing infrastructure projects in the country.  
She noted that the allocated funds, which are channelled to these projects through the Annual Budget Funding Amount, did not indicate significant contributions to the total funds of these projects.  
PIAC, she said, would continue to make its case for more prudent use of the country’s petroleum revenues, to ensure that enough funds were committed to complete earmarked projects.  
Emerita Professor Ardayfio-Schandorf expressed gratitude to the Assembly Officials and stakeholders who contributed to the success of the inspections.  
The Committee remains committed to the promotion of transparency and accountability in the management of the country’s petroleum revenues,  
as enshrined in the Petroleum Revenue Management Act (PRMA), 2011 as amended.

Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Accra, Jan 21, GNA – The Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) has begun the year with the inspection of public infrastructure projects funded with petroleum revenues. 
The committee undertook a simultaneous inspection in the Greater Accra and Central Regions based on information provided by the Ministry of Finance on projects and the accompanying disbursements of petroleum revenues through the Annual Budget Funding Amount (ABFA). 
The exercise was in line with PIAC’s mandate of conducting independent assessment of the management and use of petroleum revenues to ensure maximum impact. 
A PIAC team in Accra was led by the Chair, Emerita Professor Elizabeth Ardayfio-Schandorf and by officials of the Department of Urban Roads of the Ministry of Roads and Highways, and the Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly in some project sites at Teshie and Spintex.  
They were the rehabilitation of selected roads in Teshie Camp, Southern Command and Mats (now Ghana Military Academy), the Construction of the 7.5-kilometre Teshie Link.  Teshie Link, and the Construction of a Flyover over the Tema Motorway from the Flowerpot roundabout.  
These three (3) projects, located in the Ledzokuku Municipality are at different stages of progress and received funds from the ABFA between 2019 and 2022.  
The Team toured the rehabilitated roads, a car park, and a parade ground within the Southern Command in Teshie.  
Information available to PIAC showed that the contract for this project was awarded on July 13, 2020 and was supposed to have been completed within 24 months.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project was 24% physically complete. Out of the total contract sum of GH¢145.82 million, petroleum revenue of GH¢7.39 million, representing 5.07 per cent, was disbursed to the project in 2022.  
The second project inspected by the team was the construction of the 7.5-kilometre Teshie Link.  
It involved the construction of a new road and drainage structures with earthworks and asphaltic concrete surfacing.  
Awarded on 18th October 2019, the project had an original contract duration of 18 months.  
Out of the original contract sum of GH¢87.88 million petroleum revenue of GH¢29.73 million, representing 33.84 per cent was disbursed to the project from 2019 to 2021.  
The PIAC Team was informed that the Teshie Link Road is a dual carriageway that commences in the South on the Accra-Tema coastal road, through the LEKMA Hospital, and terminates on the Spintex Road.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, 95% of all drainage works had been completed, and asphaltic binder and wearing course laid on the road.  
The team was informed that the contractor had suspended work due to non-payment of funds. 
Outstanding works include the installation of traffic signals and road markings to show a controlled intersection.  
The absence of these had resulted in several vehicle crashes in the area.  
The third project was the construction of a flyover over the Tema Motorway, from the Flowerpot roundabout.  
Out of the revised contract sum of GH¢284,665,639.27, a total of GH¢141,093,766.84 representing 49.56 per cent, was disbursed from the ABFA in 2022.  
The project is located at the Flowerpot Roundabout, Spintex and East Legon, and involves creating access from the Motorway to the Boundary Road roundabout and an exit into Cantonments from the Giffard Road Interchange.  
It consists of one mainline bridge, two ramp bridges, four auxiliary roads, and ancillary works. At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project had made physical progress of 70%.  
In the Central Region, the PIAC Team, led by Nana Kweku Dei, a member representing the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College, a 90-bed Hostel Block at Saltpond, and an irrigation infrastructure at Mprumem. 
Accompanied by officials of the Mfantseman Municipal Assembly, the team inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College Project, which had received an amount of GH¢9,507,111.52 from the ABFA from 2012 to 2022.  
The project comprises an 18-Unit Classroom Block, Hostel facility, Administration Block, and a Laboratory.  
Since the Committee’s last visit to the project in 2020, the construction of a teachers’ bungalow has started, and a road contract has been awarded.  
The 4.6km road project, which starts within the campus and ends at the main Accra-Cape Coast highway, is currently at Phase 1 (Sub-base).  
The road contract, originally valued at GH¢8 million has been through three (3) variation orders and is currently valued at approximately GH¢27 million, primarily due to payment delays.  
The Committee also notes that the hostel facility and the 18-unit classroom block had not been fitted with beds and study desks, respectively.  
Also, the laboratory, classroom block and hostel facilities had developed structural defects at the time of PIAC’s inspection. 
In line with the Committee’s policy of visiting projects that have received funding from the ABFA and have been completed, the team inspected a 90-bed Hostel Block for the Ghana Education Service Development Institute (GESDI) at Saltpond.  
The project had received an amount of GH¢1,456,960.92 from the ABFA in 2015. GESDI is a Ghana Education Service (GES) Centre for capacity building in education-related programmes and seminars.  
The project was commissioned in 2020 with a 90-bed capacity hostel block, four (4) washrooms, two conference halls and a 100-person capacity cafeteria.

Ghana Supporters Union refutes reports of being stranded in Abidjan
GNA Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, Jan. 17, GNA – The Ghana Supporters Union has debunked reports of being stranded in Abidjan amid Ghana’s participation at the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON).
Reports emerged on social media that supporters threatened to boycott Black Stars matches over delayed payments of stipends. 
Some reports also suggested many supporters were stranded and didn’t have a place to sleep following their arrival in the Ivorian capital. 
But Mr. Kasim Awal, General Secretary of the Ghana Supporters Union, has refuted the reports, saying that none of the allegations raised above were true. 
“This allegation of us being stranded or threatening to go back home is not true. Before embarking, we were made aware that our stipends would be paid before the first match. 
“Everything we need here has been well taken care of, so I urge the public to ignore such reports,” he said. 
He also clarified that a little over 200 supporters travelled to Abidjan courtesy of the Ministry of Youth and Sports, not the purported thousands of fans.
Mr. Awal further stated that they were focused on supporting the Black Stars in their remaining matches at the AFCON as they sought to get back to winning ways. 
The Black Stars are scheduled to face the Pharaohs of Egypt in their second Group B encounter slated for the Stade Félix-Houphouët-Boigny on Thursday, January 18, 2024. GNA

‘Oxygen City Road’, other projects take off in Ho   | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Ho, Jan. 14, GNA – Works have begun on a 1.2-kilometre road in the Ho Municipality that connects to the Aflao highway in the Volta Region, under the Ghana Secondary Cities Support Programme.  
 Mr Divine Bosson, the Ho Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), told the media during a tour of the project, that the road, known as the (Oxygen City Street), would open up many fast-growing communities in the area. 
“The Oxygen City Street will give meaning to the oxygen city concept. It will have a two-sided drain and we will demonstrate the environmental concept with trees etc.” 
The project is being undertaken by Messrs First Sky, and, when completed, would enable works on a major bridge across the south-bound highway to progress. 
The MCE showed the press some wrongly cited buildings obstructing the road project and said all those buildings would be pulled down. 
The team, comprising planners and engineers from the Assembly, inspected works on other roads including a popular alternative route to the market, informally named the “scrap road.” 
Work is also expected to be completed on a bridge connecting the Ho Central Market, the neglect of which had seen several demonstrations to draw attention to its completion. 
A short strategic road in the heart of town, which had been sealed off with unauthorised buildings, is also being constructed. 
The MCE had taken the initiative to open up the road and several others like it in the Municipality, when he assumed office. 
Mr Bosson said more than two kilometres of roads would be completed within nine months for GHC6.6 million sourced from the Third Installment of the World Bank’s Urban Development Grant. 
Roads in the central market would also be upgraded, he said and reminded traders there to free up the curbs for the works to commence. 
The First Sky and Openya Construction Ltd are undertaking the projects.

Accra-Kumasi Highway Dualisation: Road Minister inspects progress of four by-passes 
Konongo (Ash), Jan. 04, GNA – Mr Kwasi Amoako -Atta, Minister for Roads, and Highways, has expressed satisfaction about the progress of work on the four by-passes currently under construction, as part of the Accra-Kumasi highway dualisation project. 
     He applauded all eight contractors working on the projects who are Ghanaian firms for making a strong case for local contractors by delivering quality work. 
       The Minister who was inspecting the projects made up of the Osino by-pass, Anyinam by-pass, Enyiresi by-pass and Konongo by-pass, said local contractors were deliberately selected in line with the Presidents vision to promote local content in project execution. 
      Accompanied by officials of the Ghana Highway Authority (GHA), Mr. Amoako-Atta inspected all four project sites and interacted with the contractors to learn at first hand their challenges and how to address them. 
      The four by-pass projects which are being executed at a cost of GH¢1.9 billion are 45 kilometres in total. 
      The expectation is that, travelling hours and congestion on the central corridor would significantly reduce upon completion of the projects in 30 months, except for the Konongo by-pass, which is scheduled for completion in 36 months. 
      Current work being done at the various sites visited by the Minister are demolishing and site clearing, earth works, culverts and drainage, as well as concrete works. 
      Common challenges confronting the projects as narrated by the contractors included low hanging high tension cables, existing deep galamsay pits, and new galamsay activities in the Birim River. 
      Others are compensation issues and difficulty in getting gravel material because of farms along the stretch. 
      The Minister promised to engage relevant stakeholders to find solutions to the challenges to ensure smooth execution of the projects, saying that the national interest must prevail over all others. 
       “The selection of eight different contractors to handle this project was informed by the fact that we wanted the work to be carried out simultaneously with the same speed,” he pointed out. 
     He stated that, “I keep on saying that President Akuffo Addo’s government for the past seven years has built capacities of local contractors to handle road works of any magnitude in this country.” 
      He said the President promised to continue the dualisation of the Accra-Kumasi highway in 2018 and that he remained committed to redeeming the promise. 
    Government would continue to stand solidly behind local contractors to empower them to play significant role in national development, he assured. 
      He said the government was determined to ensure sustainable funding for the project, allaying fear of the possibility of the project being stalled along the way.

Sunyani Urban Development Park project slows   | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
By Dennis Peprah  Sunyani, Jan. 3, GNA – Mr John Ansu Kumi, the Sunyani Municipal Chief Executive, and other stakeholders have visited the construction site of an urban development park in the municipality to assess the progress of work.  
It is under the implementation of the Phase Three of the Secondary City Support Project in the Sunyani Municipality. 
Under the Third Phase, Sunyani is benefiting from a three-acre landfill reclamation urban park development, a 500-metre long storm drain, and a 1.4-kilometre access road.  
The implementation of the World Bank’s International Development Association (IDA) credit project, which started in 2019, and spans a five-year period, is part of the Government’s broader urban development and decentralisation programme.  It would help to strengthen local systems and provide the necessary support to the municipal assemblies for effective urban management and service delivery.  
To facilitate the project implementation, an age-old heap of refuse dump at the Sunyani Area Two had been evacuated, preventing criminal activities and drug peddling, which were hitherto common there. 
However, the contractors said they were unhappy with the attitude of some residents, who had turned the project site into a place of convenience, slowing down work. 
They said that had been the major challenge confronting the project as the area had been messed up, frustrating their efforts to speed up the execution of work.  
They appealed to the Sunyani city authorities to help end the practice to facilitate work at the site.  Nonetheless, they promised to deliver quality work, complete and hand over in August 2024, as scheduled.  Excavation works, including clearing and construction of a huge steel bridge were ongoing on the 1.4-kilometre access road linking Petra Hotel and Sunyani Estate to the Sunyani Jubilee Park area when the team visited. 
Mr Kumi inspired the contractors, despite the challenges, to speed up work and gave the assurance that the Municipal Assembly would introduce stringent measures to control the open defecation at the area.  He called on the residents to desist from the practice, saying: “You are going to benefit most, and we must all come together and flush out the miscreants whose behaviour is frustrating the contractors and slowing down  the execution of the work”.   Meanwhile, some of the residents, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, appealed to the Municipal Assembly to construct additional public toilets for the area as the only male and female toilets were insufficient. 
They said many of the compound houses had no toilets, hence the occupants depended on the few public ones when the need arose,  which contributed to the practice.

To facilitate the project implementation, an age-old heap of refuse dump at the Sunyani Area Two had been evacuated, preventing criminal activities and drug peddling, which were hitherto common there. 
However, the contractors said they were unhappy with the attitude of some residents, who had turned the project site into a place of convenience, slowing down work. 
They said that had been the major challenge confronting the project as the area had been messed up, frustrating their efforts to speed up the execution of work.  
They appealed to the Sunyani city authorities to help end the practice to facilitate work at the site.  Nonetheless, they promised to deliver quality work, complete and hand over in August 2024, as scheduled.  Excavation works, including clearing and construction of a huge steel bridge were ongoing on the 1.4-kilometre access road linking Petra Hotel and Sunyani Estate to the Sunyani Jubilee Park area when the team visited. 
Mr Kumi inspired the contractors, despite the challenges, to speed up work and gave the assurance that the Municipal Assembly would introduce stringent measures to control the open defecation at the area.  He called on the residents to desist from the practice, saying: “You are going to benefit most, and we must all come together and flush out the miscreants whose behaviour is frustrating the contractors and slowing down  the execution of the work”.   Meanwhile, some of the residents, in an interview with the Ghana News Agency, appealed to the Municipal Assembly to construct additional public toilets for the area as the only male and female toilets were insufficient. 
They said many of the compound houses had no toilets, hence the occupants depended on the few public ones when the need arose,  which contributed to the practice.

Reconstruction and Expansion of Accra-Tema Motorway begin  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Accra, Jan. 2, GNA – The reconstruction and expansion of the Accra-Tema Motorway started on Tuesday. 
The 19.5-kilometre project is a 10-lane span from the Tetteh Quarshie roundabout to the Tema roundabout. 
The project is being supervised by Maripoma Enterprise Limited, a Ghanaian-owned construction company. 
Mr Kwasi Amoako-Attah, Minister of Roads and Highways, announced this during a tour of road projects in Accra. 
The Minister and his team visited the ongoing drainage projects at Tema Community 11 and 12, and Tema Motorway expansion project. 
Mr Amoako-Atta said the Accra-Tema Motorway project was the first phase of the expansion project. 
The second project is from Tetteh Quarshie to Apenkwa while the third phase spans from Apenkwa to Neoplan. 
He assured Ghanaians that work on the project would be executed with speed and urged institutions which had erected billboards on the road to remove them as soon as possible. 
The Minister said the country would witness road evolution in 2024, characterised by the commissioning of completed projects. 
Mr Amoako-Atta was impressed with the ongoing drainage work at communities 11 and 12 and commended the contractor for the good work done. 
He urged contractors to engage the community before the start of any project to ensure effective cooperation since most of the projects normally inconvenience the residents. 
“You need to put a human face to the work you do by briefing them about the project to enable them to plan adequately on how and where to park their vehicles,” he said. 
He commended the contractors for repairing most of the slaps in the area to pave the way for the residents to have access to their houses. 
The Minister advised contractors and engineers to do quality work, stressing that any construction company that did shoddy work will face the law. 
He expressed concern about the attitudes of some contractors” who think they are doing the residents a favour when undertaking government projects.” 
“We are interested in value for money, and I will urge contractors to put the nation’s interests at heart and do excellent work,” he said. 
He said work on the Tema bridge had been completed and stated that so far, 50 of such bridges have been completed across the country. 
Mr Kingsley Attafuah, Technical Director, Raceg Construction Limited, said work on the Tema drainage system started in July 2023 and that 80 per cent of the work had been done. 
He assured Ghanaians of completing the work on schedule to pave the way for road work starting in March 2024.

Scripture Union Ghana unveils $7.4m campsite project at Pepawani  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Scripture Union Ghana unveils $7.4m campsite project at Pepawani 
Pepawani, near Aburi (E/R), Dec 25, GNA – The Scripture Union, Ghana, has cut sod for the construction of a $7.4m campsite project at Pepawani near Aburi in the Akwapim South Municipality of the Eastern Region. 
The ultra-modern multi-purpose project, situated on a 14.2 acres of land comprises a 1000-seater Main Auditorium; 1000-seater Multi-Purpose Hall, Dormitories and 13 Chalets. 
It also include facilities such as Administration Block, Sports and Fields, Prayer Garden and reserves, and Gate House with parking. 
Dubbed, the “Children and Youth Development Campsite,” the project seeks to provide accommodation for members of SU and end its reliance on public schools during mission activities. 
Also, it would help impact positively the lives of more young people through teachings. 
Speaking at a community durbar at Pepawani – Aburi to unveil the project, Reverend Morgan Fianko Asiedu, Council Chairman of SU, said over the years, Scripture Union had hosted its children and youth camps predominantly in public Senior High Schools across the country.  
That, he explained, was no longer feasible considering the difficulty in securing such facilities.  
“The difficulty of relying on public school facilities and the high cost of using private commercial facilities necessitated the need for SU Ghana to develop a campsite for the ministry,” he said.  
Rev Asiedu said the camp would, therefore, provide accommodation for its members during activities and reduce the financial burden on the Union. 
He added that, when completed, the campsite would help imbibe in the children and youth, far and near, a sense of uprightness for the benefit of the community and the nation. 
Rev Derrick Koomson, General Director of SU, said the project was a testimony of how God was using SU to reach the rest of the world.  
He noted that, the project was an opportunity for the two parties – the SU and the Pepawani community to strike a bond of friendship for the benefit of the youth and the larger community. 
“We are not just coming to construct a building, but also to train the young ones in the way of Christ so they will grow to become responsible leaders for society and the country,” he said. 
Rev Koomson indicated that the first phase of the project, which involved the construction of a 1000-seater main auditorium and other facilities, estimated at a cost of $4.9m, would commence in June 2024, while the entire project duration was five years. 
Rev Koomson also disclosed that, the campsite would be available for the use by churches for their activities, adding that nine of similar projects were taking place across the country. 
The Most Rev Paul Kwabena Boafo, the Presiding Bishop of The Methodist Church, Ghana, described the campsite as an “intentional project in investing in the young and the youth.” 
He said the project would help transform lives of young people of the community and its environs for society, the Church and the world. 
He assured the SU of the Methodist Church’s support to ensure that the project materialised. 
Nana Kwafo Kwasi Wiafe,Kyidomhene, Pepawani, thanked the leadership of the SU for the project, urging the children and youth to make good use of the facility when completed, to acquire knowledge. 
Mr Seth Kwame Acheampong, Eastern Regional Minister, commended SU and urged it to use the facility to impact positively, the lives of the young to ensure that, they grew to become responsible citizens. 
Scripture Union Ghana is an Evangelical Christian Organisation which started as a school and Bible study movement in the early 1950s.  
It has, since the early 1970s, grown beyond the boundaries of traditional evangelicalism into a hybrid – an evangelico-charismatic movement.

NRSA urged to safeguard the TransportGhanaProject against potential cybersecurity threats | Ghana News Agency

NRSA urged to safeguard the TransportGhanaProject against potential cybersecurity threats
Accra, Dec 22, GNA-Mr. Kwaku Ofori Asiamah, the Minister of Transport, has urged the National Road Safety Authority (NRSA) to safeguard the TransportGhana Project against potential cybersecurity threats.
He said although the success of its efforts to digitise the transportation sector was commendable, the Authority must approach the digitization agenda with caution by implementing the required data protection tools.
The Minister was speaking at the launch of the TransportGhana project, a digital system being introduced by the Authority in Accra.
The data protection tools, he said, would prevent any potential cybersecurity and privacy breaches 
“Though the benefits of the project are numerous and far-reaching, we must approach the project with a strong focus on safety, security, and the ethical use of technology,” he added. 
Mr Asiamah urged the NRSA and its partners to ensure that systems were updated to withstand the test of time. 
“We must safeguard against potential cybersecurity threats and ensure that the data and privacy of individuals and operators are protected,’’ he said.
He said the success of the digitization efforts in the transportation sector depended on the active involvement of all transport operators and stakeholders.
He called for stronger collaboration and partnerships to realise the full potential of the digitization efforts to create a safer, more efficient, and more sustainable transport system.
The Transport Ghana Initiative, led by the NRSA, is the name assigned to the transformation of commercial road transport services from manual to technology. In other words, automation, or digitization, of commercial road transport.
TransportGhana aligns Ghana’s road safety management with the government’s policy to digitise all sectors of the national economy.
The initiative also aims at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of commercial road transport services in the country to minimise related road casualties by at least 50 per cent by the year 2030.
Mr David Osafo Adonteng, the Acting Director-General for NRSA, said the TransportGhanaproject was the fulfilment of the government’s commitment to digitising the economy.
The key features of Transport Ghana include the e-passenger manifest, e-vehicle tracking, citizen safety reporting, road safety watch, and departure control.
The Director-General said through the provision of personal data on the e-passenger feature, identification of accident victims would be much easier.
“Other features, including citizen safety reporting and a road safety watch, could prevent road crashes as passengers are allowed to report any careless or reckless driving behaviour of motorist,” he said. 
Mr. Nana Akomea, Managing Director, State Transport Company Limited (STC), said the project was consistent with the Company’s effort to digitise its operations.
He assured the minister and all the people at the gathering that his outfit would fully utilise the project.

Road accidents; A contributor to disability  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Tamale, Dec 19, GNA- Road accidents are catastrophic in Ghana. Apart from inflicting various degrees of injuries, they have also claimed numerous lives. 
A recent report from the Motor Traffic and Transport Department of the Ghana Police Service indicated that in road crash statistics gathered for the first quarter of 2023, 544 people were killed in various road accidents in the country. 
The statistics also revealed that a total of 3,340 cases were recorded between January to March 2023, a 15.0 per cent reduction compared to the same period in 2022. 
According to the figures, the Greater Accra Region had the highest number of recorded crashes 1,243 among the 16 regions while the Oti Region recorded 15 cases being the least. 
Another report conducted by the Motor Traffic and Transport Department (MTTD) of the Ghana Police Service for July 2023 also revealed that road crashes increased by 4.31 per cent and deaths resulting from road crashes also increased by 30.07 per cent for the period and a total of 1,233 crashes were recorded involving 2,099 vehicles with 186 deaths leaving 1328 persons injured in 2023. 
The report from the Ghana Statistics Research Department indicated that road traffic crashes in Ghana 2021, by region, the country reported 48 cases of road traffic accidents in the Eastern region, which recorded the highest number of road crashes, followed by the Greater Accra and Central regions, each with 43 cases with overall, 240 road accidents were reported in the country on that year. 
There are a multitude of reasons like human mechanical and environmental factors for speeding, overtaking, overloading, reckless driving, fatigue, drunk driving, drugs, not wearing of seat belt and helmet, sleeping when driving, cell phone calls during driving, bad road network. 
Ghana is one of the middle-income countries in which most of the injuries from trauma occur due to carelessness in practising road traffic rules and regulations. 
Road traffic accidents also involve overloading and speeding which have been one of the major causes of road accidents in Ghana, accounting for the higher per cent of cars crashes. 
Statistics from the National Road Safety Commission (NRSC) show that four people die daily on Ghanaian roads and the country loses over 230 million dollars yearly due to road accidents with more than 1600 deaths. 
It stated that the loss correlated to 1.7 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product which is affecting National Development. 
Overloaded vehicles and overspeeding on the road, especially freight vehicles, are destroying our road, impacting negatively on economic growth, the damage caused grows exponentially as the load increases. 
Damage to roads as a result of overloading leads and speeding to higher maintenance and repair costs and shortens the life of a road placing an additional burden on the state and law-abiding road users who ultimately carry the costs of careless and inconsiderate overloading. 
Overloading vehicles threaten road safety and are contributing to many of the fatal accidents on roads, and putting the driver and passengers at risk. 
The overloading and speeding of a vehicle can cause the tyres to overheat and wear rapidly which increases the chance of premature, dangerous and expensive failure or blowouts. 
The driver’s control and operating space in the overloaded vehicle are diminished, escalating the chances of an accident. 
The overloaded vehicle cannot accelerate as normal which would make it difficult to overtake. 
At night, the headlights of an overloaded vehicle will tilt up, blinding oncoming drivers to possible debris or obstructions on the roadway. 
The brakes have to work hard due to the riding of brakes and because the vehicle is heavier due to overloading, brakes can also be overheated and lose effectiveness to stop the car. 
Apart from the risks involved in overloading and speeding a vehicle, the driver and the car owner would spend on higher maintenance costs to the vehicle, especially on the tyres, brakes, shock absorbers and higher fuel consumption. 
Dr Noel Tolgou Yempabe, Consultant Orthopaedic and head of the Trauma Unit at the Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH) said road traffic injuries constituted a major health problem in the country. 
He lamented that the legal framework of car insurance for road traffic accident payment delays and affects medical treatment, which could also lead to disability, emotional trauma or loss of lives. 
According to him, the consequences of road traffic injuries are crucial for everyone on the roads and stakeholders should explore the potential ramifications of such incidents. 
He also attributed most of the trauma cases were the cost of delays at the traditional bonesetters’ centres, resulting in trauma related to deaths, amputations and disabilities, especially among children. 
Mr Bawa Salifu, who is a Person with disability and shared his experience during an interview with GNA said he had a road accident some few years ago which disabled him.  
He now depends on his family and friends who take care of him, as he can no longer walk. 
Apart from the personal consequences, road traffic accidents also have societal implications such as the economic cost of road traffic injuries is substantial, including medical expenses, loss of productivity, and property damage. 
The costs are borne by individuals, insurance companies, and the healthcare system and moreover, road traffic accidents can lead to congestion, delays, and increased insurance premiums for all road users. 
In the aftermath of a road traffic accident, legal implications arise, and seeking compensation becomes paramount. 
Victims have the right to pursue a personal injury claim to recover their losses and receive compensation for their pain and suffering. 
If successful, compensation can cover various aspects, such as medical expenses, loss of earnings, rehabilitation costs, and property damage, additionally, victims may be eligible for compensation for the impact of the injuries on their quality of life, including physical and psychological suffering. 
It is highly recommended to seek legal guidance from friendly claims specialists, with experience in road traffic accident claims to guide the victims through the legal process and assess the strength of your case. 
Dr Yempabe recommended that the government should deliver a plan for emergency care services in all the hospitals around the country by providing enough healthcare delivery equipment to improve quality health care delivery. 
He also called on other International Health Organisations to support Ghana’s health sector with medical equipment and to sponsor most of the road traffic accident victims who could not afford to pay for their medical treatment due to their financial challenges. 
Dr Dominic Konadu-Yeboah, the Head of Trauma and Orthopaedics at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in a discussion with GNA gave a short education on how to give first aid to the injured person as the eyewitness. 
 He said the first step is the limb with a fracture must be splinted and elevated to reduce swelling and occult bleeding into the site of the fracture. 
The second step is if there is severe visible bleeding from a fracture site apply direct pressure using a clean cloth and elevate the affected limb to control the bleeding 
The third step was to apply ice to a fracture site which also helps to reduce limb swelling and relieve pain and send the patients to the nearby hospital for early treatment to save lives. 
Dr.Yempabe advised the public to send patients with trauma cases to hospital services for proper treatment to reduce deaths and disability in society. 
Mr Bawa Gamsah, the Northern Regional Road Safety Director said there should be enforcement of wearing seat belts when driving and also wearing a helmet when riding the motorbike or tricycles which can also prevent more injuries and deaths. 
He also appealed to the government to support the road safety agencies with adequate resources such as funds, and more staff to improve the awareness creation and education on road safety as part of the fight against road traffic accidents in the country. 
He added that mostly in the Northern sector, most of the riders are under age riding without a license which also needed to be addressed by the stakeholders including parents and guardians.    
Mr Abdulai  Mutawakilo, the Northern Regional Manager for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA)  appealed to road users to follow the Road Vehicle Regulations 2022 which were amended on the offence to include any use of a hand-held mobile phone or other interactive communication device when using the road. 
He also encouraged all road users to regularly check their own eyesight to prevent drivers with visual disorders when driving. 
The government should build a strong partnership with road safety stakeholders such as the Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Road and Highways, National Road Safety Commission (NRSC), and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) to undertake probable solutions to fix the problem caused by human-related factor on road transport system by implementing a safety systems approach. 
Stakeholders in the road and transport sector should collaborate to establish an element which would apply to all road users, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists to ensure compliance with the law to avoid causing harm on the roads.  
The highway authorities and road operators must therefore implement an efficient checking system to enforce weights and dimensions at an affordable cost. 
The government should provide a large-scale project as part of the transport system to demonstrate the feasibility of using high-speed weight motion to direct enforcement of overloaded vehicles.  
With all these challenges it will be expedient for the Government to support teaching hospitals nationwide to organise training workshops for medical practitioners yearly, to enhance their capacities in providing quality health care for the populace. 
Non-governmental Organisations and philanthropic institutions must also assist trauma and orthopaedic departments across the country for proper rehabilitation and integration of patients into society.

Tamale, Dec 19, GNA- Road accidents are catastrophic in Ghana. Apart from inflicting various degrees of injuries, they have also claimed numerous lives. 
A recent report from the Motor Traffic and Transport Department of the Ghana Police Service indicated that in road crash statistics gathered for the first quarter of 2023, 544 people were killed in various road accidents in the country. 
The statistics also revealed that a total of 3,340 cases were recorded between January to March 2023, a 15.0 per cent reduction compared to the same period in 2022. 
According to the figures, the Greater Accra Region had the highest number of recorded crashes 1,243 among the 16 regions while the Oti Region recorded 15 cases being the least. 
Another report conducted by the Motor Traffic and Transport Department (MTTD) of the Ghana Police Service for July 2023 also revealed that road crashes increased by 4.31 per cent and deaths resulting from road crashes also increased by 30.07 per cent for the period and a total of 1,233 crashes were recorded involving 2,099 vehicles with 186 deaths leaving 1328 persons injured in 2023. 
The report from the Ghana Statistics Research Department indicated that road traffic crashes in Ghana 2021, by region, the country reported 48 cases of road traffic accidents in the Eastern region, which recorded the highest number of road crashes, followed by the Greater Accra and Central regions, each with 43 cases with overall, 240 road accidents were reported in the country on that year. 
There are a multitude of reasons like human mechanical and environmental factors for speeding, overtaking, overloading, reckless driving, fatigue, drunk driving, drugs, not wearing of seat belt and helmet, sleeping when driving, cell phone calls during driving, bad road network. 
Ghana is one of the middle-income countries in which most of the injuries from trauma occur due to carelessness in practising road traffic rules and regulations. 
Road traffic accidents also involve overloading and speeding which have been one of the major causes of road accidents in Ghana, accounting for the higher per cent of cars crashes. 
Statistics from the National Road Safety Commission (NRSC) show that four people die daily on Ghanaian roads and the country loses over 230 million dollars yearly due to road accidents with more than 1600 deaths. 
It stated that the loss correlated to 1.7 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product which is affecting National Development. 
Overloaded vehicles and overspeeding on the road, especially freight vehicles, are destroying our road, impacting negatively on economic growth, the damage caused grows exponentially as the load increases. 
Damage to roads as a result of overloading leads and speeding to higher maintenance and repair costs and shortens the life of a road placing an additional burden on the state and law-abiding road users who ultimately carry the costs of careless and inconsiderate overloading. 
Overloading vehicles threaten road safety and are contributing to many of the fatal accidents on roads, and putting the driver and passengers at risk. 
The overloading and speeding of a vehicle can cause the tyres to overheat and wear rapidly which increases the chance of premature, dangerous and expensive failure or blowouts. 
The driver’s control and operating space in the overloaded vehicle are diminished, escalating the chances of an accident. 
The overloaded vehicle cannot accelerate as normal which would make it difficult to overtake. 
At night, the headlights of an overloaded vehicle will tilt up, blinding oncoming drivers to possible debris or obstructions on the roadway. 
The brakes have to work hard due to the riding of brakes and because the vehicle is heavier due to overloading, brakes can also be overheated and lose effectiveness to stop the car. 
Apart from the risks involved in overloading and speeding a vehicle, the driver and the car owner would spend on higher maintenance costs to the vehicle, especially on the tyres, brakes, shock absorbers and higher fuel consumption. 
Dr Noel Tolgou Yempabe, Consultant Orthopaedic and head of the Trauma Unit at the Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH) said road traffic injuries constituted a major health problem in the country. 
He lamented that the legal framework of car insurance for road traffic accident payment delays and affects medical treatment, which could also lead to disability, emotional trauma or loss of lives. 
According to him, the consequences of road traffic injuries are crucial for everyone on the roads and stakeholders should explore the potential ramifications of such incidents. 
He also attributed most of the trauma cases were the cost of delays at the traditional bonesetters’ centres, resulting in trauma related to deaths, amputations and disabilities, especially among children. 
Mr Bawa Salifu, who is a Person with disability and shared his experience during an interview with GNA said he had a road accident some few years ago which disabled him.  
He now depends on his family and friends who take care of him, as he can no longer walk. 
Apart from the personal consequences, road traffic accidents also have societal implications such as the economic cost of road traffic injuries is substantial, including medical expenses, loss of productivity, and property damage. 
The costs are borne by individuals, insurance companies, and the healthcare system and moreover, road traffic accidents can lead to congestion, delays, and increased insurance premiums for all road users. 
In the aftermath of a road traffic accident, legal implications arise, and seeking compensation becomes paramount. 
Victims have the right to pursue a personal injury claim to recover their losses and receive compensation for their pain and suffering. 
If successful, compensation can cover various aspects, such as medical expenses, loss of earnings, rehabilitation costs, and property damage, additionally, victims may be eligible for compensation for the impact of the injuries on their quality of life, including physical and psychological suffering. 
It is highly recommended to seek legal guidance from friendly claims specialists, with experience in road traffic accident claims to guide the victims through the legal process and assess the strength of your case. 
Dr Yempabe recommended that the government should deliver a plan for emergency care services in all the hospitals around the country by providing enough healthcare delivery equipment to improve quality health care delivery. 
He also called on other International Health Organisations to support Ghana’s health sector with medical equipment and to sponsor most of the road traffic accident victims who could not afford to pay for their medical treatment due to their financial challenges. 
Dr Dominic Konadu-Yeboah, the Head of Trauma and Orthopaedics at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in a discussion with GNA gave a short education on how to give first aid to the injured person as the eyewitness. 
 He said the first step is the limb with a fracture must be splinted and elevated to reduce swelling and occult bleeding into the site of the fracture. 
The second step is if there is severe visible bleeding from a fracture site apply direct pressure using a clean cloth and elevate the affected limb to control the bleeding 
The third step was to apply ice to a fracture site which also helps to reduce limb swelling and relieve pain and send the patients to the nearby hospital for early treatment to save lives. 
Dr.Yempabe advised the public to send patients with trauma cases to hospital services for proper treatment to reduce deaths and disability in society. 
Mr Bawa Gamsah, the Northern Regional Road Safety Director said there should be enforcement of wearing seat belts when driving and also wearing a helmet when riding the motorbike or tricycles which can also prevent more injuries and deaths. 
He also appealed to the government to support the road safety agencies with adequate resources such as funds, and more staff to improve the awareness creation and education on road safety as part of the fight against road traffic accidents in the country. 
He added that mostly in the Northern sector, most of the riders are under age riding without a license which also needed to be addressed by the stakeholders including parents and guardians.    
Mr Abdulai  Mutawakilo, the Northern Regional Manager for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA)  appealed to road users to follow the Road Vehicle Regulations 2022 which were amended on the offence to include any use of a hand-held mobile phone or other interactive communication device when using the road. 
He also encouraged all road users to regularly check their own eyesight to prevent drivers with visual disorders when driving.

Accra-Tema Motorway Redevelopment: Parliament approves $338 million loan 
Accra, Dec 16, GNA – Parliament on Friday approved an amount of $338 million for the redevelopment and expansion of the Accra-Tema Motorway project. 
The redevelopment of the Accra-Tema Motorway had become necessary owing to damages which frequently resulted in traffic congestion and accidents. 
The redevelopment would include construction works on the 5.7 km George Walker Bush Highway and a portion of the Nsawam road linking the Neoplan Interchange to Apenkwa. 
Mr Patrick Yaw Boamah, the Vice Chairman of the Finance Committee of Parliament, last week announced to the media that such a loan agreement was in Parliament seeking approval. 
He said: “The Accra-Tema motorway alone is 19.5 kilometres, but this project is 27.7 kilometres, so one may ask, where are you getting the remainder from? The entire project is divided into three sections, the first section is the Accra-Tema Motorway, which is 19.5 kilometres, and it is going to be the rehabilitation and expansion of a minimum of ten lanes on the motorway. Then, the second section is N1, the George Walker Bush highway, and the scope is 5.7 kilometres while the third scope is the Nsawam road, rehabilitation of the existing six lanes on the Nsawam road.” 
“…So this is the scope of work that is going to happen. So you can tell from what I have told you that it is going to be a very comprehensive programme that will span about three years or more depending on how the project goes. And it is going to be a joint venture between Maripoma Limited and Ghana Infrastructure Fund,” Mr Boamah told the media.

2024 is “Year of Completion”— Roads Minister | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Accra, Dec. 13, GNA – Mr Kwasi Amoako – Attah, Minister of Roads and Highways, has declared next year, 2024, as a “Year of Completion” to complete all commissioned and stalled roads projects in the country. 
He said the Ministry would ensure that all road projects, which started from 2017, especially projects in 2020 and 2021 under the “Year of Roads”, were completed by the end of 2024. 
Mr Amoako-Attah said this at an inspection of a soon-to-start two dual carriage road projects at Kasoa and Adentan. 
They comprised a 30 kilometre Kasoa to Winneba Roundabout dual carriage road and a 23-kilometre Adentan to Dodowa dual carriage road. 
The two projects will commence officially on January 01, 2024, after preparatory work and mobilisation are done. 
The Kasoa to Winneba dual carriage stretch would have double service lanes on each side, intersections and flyovers at Kasoa-Buduburam and Winneba Junction and would be completed in 36 months. 
The Adentan to Dodowa stretch would also be a dual carriage with double lanes on each side with service lanes and intersections and completed in 24 months. 
The Kasoa project is being undertaken by Nag Fairmount Company Limited, whereas the Adentan one is being done by Oswal Investments Limited; all local contractors. 
The Minister said the Kasoa and Adentan projects were part of four critical projects the Ministry would be undertaking in the year alongside the completion of existing ones. 
“These two road projects when completed will bring relief to the public, since it would ease traffic and make it safer to use the roads. They are two critical road networks that need to be dualised and opened to ease the stress on using them,” he added. 
Mr Amoako-Attah said the Ministry had in the last seven years built the capacity of more than 20 local contractors to enable them handle critical road projects. 
The Minister said the contractors had been instructed to work 24/7 to complete the projects on schedule.
