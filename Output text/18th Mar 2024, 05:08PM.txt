The Edevu hydro power station construction is on schedule, with all work to be completed by the end of September, 2023.
The Edevu power project, opened in April this year, will supply 54 megawatts into the Port Moresby grid with 2x turbines each producing 27 megawatts.
The current peak loan demand in Port Moresby grid is 132 megawatts.
PNG Power chairman McRonald Nale said Edevu’s bigger sized generating units with higher inertia will add stability to the Port Moresby grid.
“With Edevu, Port Moresby grid will have an improved ability to withstand electrical shocks and disturbances, thereby reducing network blackouts. 
Having high inertia machines from Edevu will significantly reduce total system outages caused by network cascading effects. 
Edevu hydro power brings clean, fuel free and low-cost power to supply increasing demand in the Port Moresby grid,” Mr Nale said.
PPL estimates about 40 to 50 megawatts are produced and utilised by large industries off grid due to reliability issues.
“With low cost power from Edevu hydro, this will improve network regulation and improved attention to our customers through a range of initiatives, including Amnesty Program and Feeder Team Management, we believe the industries not on the PPL grid will reconnect,” Mr Nale said.
PNG Hydro Development Ltd managing director Allan Guo said the total towers of the main transmission lines to be built from Edevu to the Moitaka is 104.
“Work on erecting and stringing of towers is completed from tower 1- tower 39. From tower 39 — 89, erection of towers completed without stringing. 
This week, our contractors will be working on towers 90 — 95, that is doing the foundation work and so forth,” Mr Guo said.
By the end of September, PNG Power will officially do the technical commissioning for the Edevu Hydro Power Station, and will run on full operation for three days, before final tests are done and the official commissioning takes place.

On August 1, 2023, the Chief Ombudsman Richard Pagen contacted the City Manager Frank Ravu regarding concerns with the bypass road leading from the Konedobu Roundabout to the Koura Roundabout. 
This intervention was triggered by a recent natural disaster.
A statement from the OC states on July 7, 2023, a magnitude 5.5 earthquake struck the eastern part of Papua New Guinea.
The tremour caused structural damage to the road, primarily due to the inadequate compaction of its bottom layers, resulting in a noticeable depression on its surface.
This intervention by the OC was not in response to a specific complaint, but rather an own initiative to address an infrastructure issue in the city caused by the natural disaster.
Upon receiving the Chief’s communication, the City Manager promptly dispatched an engineering team to assess the situation and conduct a soil test to ensure the safety of commuters; gravel was laid as a temporary solution. 
While NCDC organised to engage a contractor for the complete repair of the road.
A road construction company was awarded the contract for 1 month to repair the road.
Within two weeks, they successfully completed one lane, and they are currently focused on completing the second lane.
The dimensions of the road repair cover a length of 60 metres, a width of 6 metres, and a depth of 3 metres, ensuring the restoration of a safe and strong roadway.
The Ombudsman Commission acknowledges and commends the City Manager Frank Ravu and his team for their swift response and proactive efforts in addressing this critical road infrastructure issue.
The timely intervention has ensured the safety and convenience of the commuters in the affected area.
The prompt response and successful road repair reflects the Ombudsman Commission’s commitment to public safety and efficient governance.

Construction will soon begin on the Indagen-Lae Road project in Kabwum, Morobe Province.
Morobe Governor Luther Wenge did the ground-breaking ceremony in Indagen village last Friday witnessed by people from the Komba, Selepet and Deyamos local level governments.
Governor Wenge said the people of Kabwum really need a road link to Lae and this road will be a priority.
He said funding of K2 million from Morobe provincial services improvement program has been allocated to upgrade the road from Tipsit to Indagen.
“Once this is done, I will allocate another K10 million for road construction to begin from Indagen in Kabwum to Burum-Kuat in Finschhafen and finally into Samanzing in Nawaeb to Lae,” he said.
“Work on this road should start in the next three weeks once machineries are shipped to Wasu from Lae.
“It will start here in Indagen and then going towards Lae and not from Lae to Indagen.”
Governor Wenge said Finschhafen MP Rainbo Paita and Prime Minister James Marape have pledged commitments to support the road project.
However, he did not reveal the commitments pledge but stated that he will closely follow-up with them on this funding commitments to deliver this economic road for the people of Kabwum.

A THIRTY-six kilometre Ring Road Project in the Rigo North LLG of Rigo District in Central Province has been completed by Koia Investment Company Limited.
The Ring Road will now serve 20 council wards of North Rigo LLG who have been suffering from lack of better road access for the last 27 years. The Ring Road project was funded by the Central Provincial Government under the works program.
Present during the completion of the road last Sunday (27th August) were ), respective community leaders of Rigo North owner of the construction company Biari Ubuna, Acting Police Station Commander of Kwikila police station, Sergeant Bobby Ogara and a representative from the Rigo district development authority.
A community Leader Murray Gini thanked the constructor and the Central provincial government for providing the needed service to the 17, 000 plus population of Rigo North.
“The 20 council wards in the hinterland of Rigo District gratefully accolade praise to the management of KICL for the construction of Sivitatana – Wiga road connection,” Gini said.
“The road has been cut off for public use for about 27 years ago, which in other words can be put as political negligence for the last 5 terms by the previous governments.
“The Prime Minister James Marape declared the Rigo Inland Ring Road as Yagabo Highway when he was invited at Boregaina Village in late 2020 and he had announced K27 million for the road project.
In proceed to that announcement, this portion of the road was not accounted for and this has led our people to uncertainty of the effectiveness of government commitments.
“The people of Rigo North wish to give special thanks and accord to KICL, our sincere appreciation for the great achievement in bringing the road home to us.”
Biari thanked the leaders and people of Rigo North for working together with the constructor and successfully completed the project.
“The constructor is not here to make money but to deliver the needed service to the people of Rigo North.
Even though the scope of the road project ends at Dilikomana village, yet we have continued further for about 8 kilometres to Matanatou Sub Health Centre to fully connect the Ring Road. 
Biari further acknowledged and thanked the Central provincial government for making the funding available to complete the Ring Road project.

Projects roll on as Belt and Road Initiative reaches milestone - Post Courier
					Papua New Guinea's 'trupla' leading Daily Newspaper Since 1969.The Post-Courier is proud of its record as the voice of PNG. We were there when the nation took its first bold steps towards independence. Since that time, we have fearlessly recorded the nation's progress.				
			Projects roll on as Belt and Road Initiative reaches milestone

China’s Belt and Road Initiative has gained momentum since its commencement 10 years ago in 2013.
Initially it had a regional focus but rapidly expanded beyond central Asia towards the Middle East, Africa, South America, Eastern Europe and the Indo Pacific regions, making it the biggest such program since the Marshall Plan after World War II.
Logically, there was a sharp increase in the number of projects, total investments committed and executed, and the number of countries joining as partners. 
The current number of countries and organizations stand at over 150.
China stressed that the BRI was a new model for partnership, trade and integration that was free from hegemonic pressures and conditions. Later the principles of multilateralism, environment and sustainability were embedded in the BRI.
The West, fearing China’s rapid influence through the BRI, came up with competing initiatives such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (G7), the Global Gateway (EU), the Quality Infrastructure Investment Program (Japan), and others, but their ability to rival the BRI in scale is yet to be established.
As PNG joined these 150 other countries and organizations in Beijing this month to review their involvements in the BRI, the Post-Courier takes a brief look at three projects that have been rolled out in PNG under the auspices of the BRI.
The PNG national power grid, which includes a 132kV transmission and substations for Mt Hagen, Mendi, Tari, represents the first collaborative energy infrastructure endeavor between PNG and China under the Belt and Road Initiative.
This project closely aligns with PNG’s national energy strategy, which aims to increase electricity accessibility from the current 15% to 70% by 2030 and ultimately transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
The project is funded by the China Exim Bank and executed by the contractor TBEA Co., Ltd.
The project owner is PNG Power, the project scope consists of the construction of four new 132kV substations (Mt. Hagen, Pauanda, Mendi, and Tari) and a 180-kilometer 132kV transmission line connecting these substations.
Upon completion, it significantly increased the power grid coverage, effectively alleviated energy shortages, and greatly improved grid stability and reliability in the Highlands region.
The project directly benefits residents of the three Highlands provinces (Western Highlands Province, Southern Highlands Province and Hela Province) and provides power to adjacent mining projects, including gold and copper mines.
Consequently, it will efficiently stimulate economic growth in those regions connected by the power grid. 
This initiative can also meet the electricity demands of millions of households and residents, thus improving the quality of life for local communities.
Before 2015, due to the complex geographical environment and insufficient transportation infrastructure, internet access remained relatively expensive in PNG, with only about 12 percent of PNG residents connected to the internet.
There was no backbone network in PNG. The backbone communication network between islands was mainly low-bandwidth and high-cost transmission network such as satellite and microwave. The bandwidth was limited.
New services such as high-speed mobile Internet could not be launched. 
With the development of the local economy, the existed bandwidth could not meet the market requirements.
The PNG National Submarine Cable Network Project (NSCNP) was implemented by PNG DataCo Ltd, a wholesale subsidiary of Kumul Telikom Holdings and a State-owned commercial entity.
This project was one of the high priority projects included in the Framework Agreement on Development Cooperation between China and PNG signed on July 8, 2016. 
The project was financed by EXIM Bank and was completed in June 2020.
This project was a 5457km submarine fiber cable network project connecting 14 major cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang and Lae. 
At the same time, 14 submarine cable landing sites were built in 14 cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang, and Lae, to install submarine cable terminal equipment and network access equipment. 
Two data centers were also built in Port Moresby and Madang, used for supporting the operation of submarine cable services.
Firstly, the project has improved the bandwidth, reliability and stability of PNG’s domestic network.
It helped reduce the internet pricing by introducing competition mechanism;Secondly, the project connects PNG to China through Indonesia. 
The submarine cable has become an important international network channel for the South Pacific island countries;
Thirdly, the project drives the digital economy to help the country’s socio-economic progress and development.
Early in 2000, Fujian Province of China and Eastern Highlands Province of PNG signed a sister province agreement and listed Juncao and upland rice technology as the aiding technology to Eastern Highlands Province by Fujian Province. 
This project was carried out by the team of Prof. Lin Zhanxi from Fujian University of Agriculture and Forestry (FUAF). This project is now in its fourth phase.
In November 2018, during President Xi’s visit to PNG, leaders of the two countries witnessed the signing of the project, the first phase of which started in August 2019 and ended in August 2022. 
In February 2022, the two countries signed the second phase of the project, which will be implemented over a three-year period from September 2022 to August 2025.
The project has overcome the difficulties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, and has overfulfilled the tasks of the project in the fields of training, demonstration, production and extension.
In total, 27 technical training courses have been held, and a total of 2,921 people have been trained; Juncao mushroom, Juncao animal husbandry, and upland rice planting have been promoted to 17 districts in nine provinces, with a total of more than 10,000 farmers and 40,000 people benefiting from the project; and set the world record for highest output of pennisetum giganteum (Juncao grass), which was 8.53 tons per hectare.
Eastern Highlands Province has listed the Juncao and upland rice industries as the second and third major agricultural industries to be developed after the coffee industry.
The project has benefited many farmers in PNG and improved the agricultural skills level of the farmers. 
It became a model of Belt and Road Initiative cooperation between China and PNG, and played a very important role in deepening the development cooperation between the two countries and the sister-province relationship between Fujian and Eastern Highlands provinces.
The project team has provided local farmers with 1,226,700 Juncao mushroom tubes, and more than 1,725 farmers have participated in the cultivating Juncao mushroom.
The farmers mainly produce oyster mushroom and sell the harvested fresh mushroom to supermarkets, local market and supermarkets in Port Moresby.
Zaka Abori, a woman mushroom farmer, started growing mushroom in February 2020 with the help of Chinese experts and selling them through supermarkets, Facebook and social media.
The profit of growing mushroom are 20-30 times higher than her original cabbage cultivation, and the expansion of her earnings has allowed her to independently set up a tube production workshop, and her Juncao mushroom business is booming.
Farmers have planted more than 130 hectares of Juncao grass, and 1798 households have raised chickens, pigs, sheep, cows and other livestock using Juncao grass, significantly reducing their costs. 
In 7 districts including Goroka, Lufa, Hengenofi, Unggai Bena, Daulo and Kainantu, the project has promoted upland rice cultivation over 1215 hectares, and has supported more than 20 large upland rice producers and cooperatives, and promoted 7604 growers, which has brought great economic benefits to the local community.
The implementation of the project has promoted the development of Juncao, livestock and upland rice industries in PNG through technical training and demonstration, and opened up a new way for increasing employment and farmers’ income, as well as environmental protection, coping with climate change and sustainable development in PNG.

In Beijing this week, the tenth-year milestone of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be marked at a forum that highlights this often-debated model for economic development.
Large signs reading "The Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation" are displayed next to a bustling Beijing road. The previous forums convened in 2017 and 2019.  
This program, championed by China's President Xi Jinping, has provided funding for numerous global infrastructure projects, including ports, power plants, and railways. Nevertheless, the initiative has received criticism for its approach to providing loans to developing nations, which often results in them incurring substantial debt.
Wang Yiwei, the Director of the Institute of International Affairs at China's Renmin University, asserts that BRI encourages a collaborative approach to development with partner nations, providing them with paths to modernization.
Recent events, such as the construction of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in Indonesia, which commenced earlier this month, underscore the mixed reception BRI has encountered. While this 142-kilometer railway significantly reduces travel time between Jakarta and Bandung, it was marred by delays and escalating costs. Originally expected to launch in 2019, disputes over land acquisition, environmental concerns, and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the project. Furthermore, the estimated cost of 66.7 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion USD) ballooned to 113 trillion rupiah ($7.3 billion USD).
Similarly, the $5.9 billion Chinese-built railway linking Laos' capital, Vientiane, to the southern Chinese city of Kunming began operations in 2021, with over 60% of the investment being borrowed – an unusually high percentage for an infrastructure project, according to foreign experts. This has led to the initiative being perceived by some as a "debt trap."
Chinese contractors are also constructing a high-speed rail line from Bangkok to the Laos border, expected to be operational by 2028.
An example of a debt issue emerged earlier this year when a power plant in Jordan, once touted as a groundbreaking project to provide the country with a significant energy source, turned sour. Jordan now finds itself in an international legal battle and billions of dollars in debt to China for a plant that is no longer necessary for its energy needs, due to subsequent agreements made since the project's inception.
A "risk prevention" approach will be critical for the future of the Belt and Road Initiative, given the growing complications in a world marked by ongoing conflicts.
The Belt and Road Initiative Forum is scheduled to commence on October 18.

Kenyan President William Ruto arrives in China for Belt and Road Forum
                                                      Kenya's President William Ruto poses during a photo session at the Palais Brongniart for the New Global Financial Pact Summit in Paris on June 22, 2023.
                                                                                    -  
Kenyan President William Ruto has arrived in Beijing to participate in the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, scheduled for two days in the Chinese capital.
This forum holds great diplomatic significance for China, as it's the most important event of the year and a notable celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
Over 140 countries and 30 international organizations, including leaders, officials, and representatives from various sectors, have confirmed their participation.
The Belt and Road Initiative, initiated by China in 2013, aims to create trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia, Europe, Africa, and beyond along the historic Silk Road trade routes.
In the past decade, over 150 countries and 30 international organizations have engaged with the BRI framework, marking a significant milestone in global cooperation.
William Ruto intends to ask China for a $1 billion loan and a debt repayment restructuring plan, the country's vice-president said on Friday.
According to Rigathi Gachagua, the head of state, who criticized his predecessor's heavy borrowing from Beijing, will visit China at an unspecified date. He will ask for "more time to slowly repay the debt", as well as a billion dollars to complete road projects delayed by lack of funding.
Kenya, one of East Africa's largest economies, has accumulated more than $68 billion in debt, equivalent to 67% of its gross domestic product.
"We are a responsible government, we can't say we won't pay the debt," Rigathi Gachagua told a local radio station.
China, which William Ruto has not visited since his election in August 2022, is the country's second-largest creditor, after the World Bank.
In Mombasa, East Africa's largest port on the Kenyan coast, it is financing the construction of a new terminal.
Beijing has also lent $5 billion (€4.7 billion) for the realization of the most expensive infrastructure project since the country's independence in 1963: the train line that since 2017 has linked the port city of Mombasa to Naivasha, in the Rift Valley, via the capital Nairobi.
During the election campaign, William Ruto had denounced the loans of his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta, pledging to find other ways of stimulating development to build the country's necessary infrastructure.
China has rejected criticism that its lavish loans are plunging some countries, particularly in Africa, into debt overload.
During a visit to Kenya in July, Beijing's head of diplomacy, Wang Yi, praised bilateral cooperation and a "win-win" partnership.
Despite a dynamic economy, around a third of Kenya's population lives in poverty.
Economic growth slowed to 4.8% last year, from 7.6% in 2021, hit by the global fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a devastating regional drought that hit the country's vital agricultural sector.
Inflation remained high, at an annual rate of 6.8% last month.
In July, global ratings' agency Fitch Ratings downgraded Kenya's ability to repay international lenders from "stable to negative", citing tax hikes and social unrest.

China cuts lending as Belt and Road shifts focus [Business Africa]
                                                      Business Africa presenter Ronald Kato (Left) during the interview with Kanyi Lui, partner and head of China at Pinsent Masons (Right)
                                                                                    -  
Since 2013, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has helped bankroll a boom in African infrastructure, allowing credit-starved countries to build railways, hydropower projects, roads, airports and communications.
The initiative also led to a surge in Chinese investment in areas such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture.
The program has made Beijing the biggest financier of infrastructure in Africa.
But a decade down the road, some observers say the Belt and Road Initiative may be losing steam as Beijing becomes more averse to risk and as the domestic economy struggles to return to pre-pandemic growth levels.
Our guest this week is Kanyi Lui, a partner and head of China at Pinsent Masons.
Kanyi has decades of experience in international project finance and has provided legal services to several Belt and Road projects around the world.
Nearly every business lost something during the political unrest in Senegal in early June. The damage to the west African country's economic output was estimated at $33 million per day.
With President Macky Sall's announcement that he won't be seeking re-election next year, businesses are hoping to rebuild and to flourish.
Nigeria's inflation has not eased since the beginning of 2023. Prices continued to climb in June, following the end of a fuel subsidy in May.
Inflation has been in double-digits in Africa's biggest economy since 2016, eroding savings and incomes.

Algeria partners China for construction of 6,000km railway lines 
                                                      Railway line
                                                                                    -  
China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the "best guarantee of development", stressing that "our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km." The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
"China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner," said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
"The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth," he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
"As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities," said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
"This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone," echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

Koura Way had to be cut through new terrain joining the Port Moresby backwater suburb of June Valley and Hanuabada, and also opening up the area for development.
The project, costing the NCDC K80 million, adds to the fast-developing road network for the Nation’s Capital.
However, that has done little to ease the traffic congestion between 7.30am and 8.30am every morning from Monday to Friday.
It was opened in September 2018 by then Works Minister Michael Nali.
Minister Nali at the time said: “The city is moving in the right direction, you have the opening of this K80 million road project, you know the Government has given up to K2 billion to National Capital District Commission for all these roads, stadiums, all hospitals, and the flyover.
“When we built the Poreporena Freeway, critics said it was a waste of money, yet they drive on the freeway,” he said.
Koura Way itself is 4.5km with the bypass to Poreporena Freeway opening at two locations behind the police headquarters and near the Weigh Inn motel.
However, as seen in the pictures taken by Post-Courier, over time the road heading into the Ranuguri tunnel has eroded and a near sinkhole opened up before it was closed, however the road kept dropping.
According to information received the road will be closed for the next few weeks.

EAST New Britain is in for further economic development in the province.
This follows plans afoot for a major ground breaking ceremony later this week for the construction of a four-lane highway from Tokua to Kokopo City.
The ground breaking ceremony for the two phase multi- million-kina project will mark the first which is the construction of a 17km stretch of road from Tokua to Kokopo.
According to a statement released by the East New Britain Governor Michael Marum, Prime Minister James Marape and Minister for Works and Highway Solan Misirin will officiate at the event.
Governor Marum: “Their visit will also coincide with the launch of the Kokopo district five-year development plan and eight other major projects for the district.
“These projects include the Duke of York ringroad, Kibil Health Centre rehabilitation work, Kokopo City Hall, and the 4km Kabaleo road.”
He said Mr Marape will be there on the Governor’s invitation to see other project areas also in the province.
The Prime Minister will visit the Rabaul town electrification projects and the solar farm.
The Tokua to Kokopo City road project is one of three major road developments which Mr Marape is committed.
The other two projects include the South Coast Road in Pomio launched in December last year by Pomio MP Elias Kapavore and the New Britain Highway.
Mr Marape will be accompanied by other senior Government Ministers including Planning Minister Rainbo Paita and Treasurer Ian Ling-Stuckey.

Colonial road track in Hela undergoes rehabilitation work - Post Courier

A famous track used by the colonial administrators to travel between Koroba and Lake Kopiago in the Hela Province has been rehabilitated, thanks to the local MP Mr William Bando who spent no time to open up that missing link.
The Koroba-Kopiago district development authority, under the leadership of their local MP Mr William Bando, wasted no time to construct the Teria-Yagabi to Kakoma road, a colonial track that was used as a short cut to travel between Koroba and Kopaigo.
The Teria-Yaguabi to Kakoma road is among 8 other rundown roads that are undergoing major rehabilitation and maintenance, a major development initiative undertaken by the local MP within the first one year in office. 
Since being elected into office, Mr Bando prioritised law and order and road network in his district. 
He said opening up road accessibility and opening up missing links and rundown road network in the province can change mindsets and the perception of people and there he wasted no time to rehabilitate all the major road network in the district that have been neglected by past leaderships.
According to the locals, the Teria-Yaguabi –Kakoma road project took just less than 4 months and covered almost 7 kilometres, and it is about to reach the main Highlands Highway which will be connecting the frontiers of Tumbutu valley in the North of Koroba to Kopiago Basin excessing 32 council wards of more than 50, 000 population which used to be known as ‘back-page’ due to lack of services delivery.
“Opening up missing link road and rehabilitation of the old colonial roads that have deteriorated overtime is indeed a welcome initiative of the MP.
“We appreciate the MPs tireless construction team on the ground for the tremendous work done in a speedy limit, providing some of the best road construction we have never seen before. 
We also acknowledge the Mr Bando for his leadership, irrespective of the political difference, he is equally distributing services to everyone and that is the kind of leadership we want to see, a matured, smart and innovative leadership,” a local said on the Koroba-Kopaigo social media forum.

Obura-Wonenara MP John Boito has fulfilled his commitment to have an excavator to start working from the back of the district towards the front.He said he had made this commitment onboard a helicopter on his campaign run to Andakombi in Marawaka in the 2022 National General Elections with ward member Michael Kudea, who requested for an excavator, if he is elected. “I told him over Vailala mountain that today you sit with me in this helicopter, but if I win tomorrow, you will get an excavator,” Mr Boito said.“I could not forget this commitment because we made it in the air, not on the ground.”The excavator and a dump truck were driven to the Asakumdi community in ward eight of the Kome local level government area in Mynyamya district, Morobe Province, where road works will begin from towards Matawaka to wherever it meets with two more excavators working from Aiyura going backwards.Mr Boito said he would work with his colleague Solen Moifa to have this part of the country connected and continue to Sindeni to link up with the Trans-Highway to Gulf and Central Province now under construction.He also made it clear to the people that the Eastern Highlands provincial government, under the chairmanship of Simon Sia, is helping him to move the changes taking place in the district.Moks Takaje, on behalf of the Asakumdi community, reflected on the launching of the Obura-Wonenara district five-year development plan at the Aiyura Valley near Kainantu a month ago, which focuses on road infrastructure, including sending an excavator to the back of Marawaka to start work from there.“This has now been fulfilled and we now commit ourselves to work together,” Mr Takaje said.Robert Rodney, on behalf of the Marawaka community, said most of the people in this part of the country have no idea of what an excavator is.“We just celebrated our 48th independence anniversary last weekend and all those years, we have not had an excavator coming this way, even a dump truck for that matter,” Mr Rodney said.Mr Boito honoured this commitment one year and a month after the declaration of his election as the MP for Obura-Wonenara in the 2022 National General Elections and three days after the Papua New Guinea’s 48th independence celebrations nationwide on September 16, 2023. The people from the rolling mountains gathered at Asakumdi to welcome Mynyamya MP Solen Moifa and Eastern Highlands Governor Simon Sia who joined Mr Boito for the presentation of the excavator.Mr Sia assured them that more machines will be coming to speed up the work in connecting these isolated communities tucked away behind the rolling mountains and encouraged the young people to take their education seriously, adding that the government is committed to supporting human resource development program.Mr Moifa stressed the importance of road access to allow services into their areas, and appealed to his people to take ownership of the heavy equipment machines. including the ones working on the Mynyamya district road.He stressed on their cooperation in terms of letting their land for the development to take place and looking after the machineries and the workers.Mr Boito also stressed on the local cooperation as well.“We will celebrate when we launch the opening of the road,” Mr Boito said.“Now is not the time.”

                                                                                    -  
Four Nigerian soldiers and two civilians were killed and two South Korean employees kidnapped by gunmen who ambushed them in southern Nigeria, the police announced on Wednesday.
The attack took place on Tuesday morning on a road in Rivers State.
Kidnappings for ransom are common in Nigeria, where criminal groups sometimes target foreigners, particularly those working in mines and construction sites far from urban areas.
"The assailants ambushed a convoy of vehicles carrying two Daewoo workers at around 9:30 am. Four soldiers escorting the Koreans and their two civilian drivers were killed in the attack," a senior state police official told AFP.
"The gunmen also kidnapped the two Koreans before fleeing," also taking the soldiers' weapons with them, added the officer, who did not wish to be named.
Rivers State Police spokeswoman Grace Iringe Koko confirmed the attack. "We are investigating the matter and will give details later," she told AFP.
Contacted by AFP, the army and the Deawoo company were not immediately available to comment on the attack.
Several Asian companies, notably Chinese and South Korean, operate in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, where they are involved in road and rail construction projects.
Foreign workers kidnapped in Nigeria in the past have often been released after paying ransom to their captors.

The people of Kinshasa cannot believe the speed at which a Turkish company has built an imposing financial complex in the heart of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, more accustomed to major Chinese projects than to these new builders of the African continent.
“It’s changed suddenly,” notes a street vendor with a laugh, who has been forced for a little over a year to move his goods as the perimeter of the construction site changes. “They work day and night, even faster than the Chinese,” adds a security agent, somewhat admiringly.
In February 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an official visit to the DRC, his umpteenth trip to Africa. Under his leadership, Ankara has invested a lot in the continent over the past two decades, to develop diplomatic but also economic ties.
Turkish companies have, for example, built a mosque in Ghana, stadiums in Rwanda or Senegal, and airports in several countries.
In Kinshasa, he concluded cooperation agreements concerning in particular security, defense and the construction of infrastructure, including the "Finance Center" whose work was quickly launched, in a concession located near the Turkish school, in the business commune of Gombe.
There was at this place, between the courthouse and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a roundabout pompously called Place de l'Independance, decorated with a sort of faded cement platform carried by stairs leading to no monument.
Visitors sometimes walked there, between the rows of plants in small bags bought by the occupants of the villas with gardens built in the area during the time of the Belgian settlers. Then the palisades and construction bungalows appeared, quickly dominated by half a dozen concrete towers gradually covered with glass panels.
Two of them, around twenty floors high, will house the Ministries of Finance and Budget. The complex, which includes nine buildings in total, will also house a convention center, offices, a large hotel, etc.
The prime contractor is the company Milvest, a subsidiary of the Turkish holding company Miller. According to its CEO Turhan Mildon, who gave a press briefing on the site in mid-September, this project will have employed some 3,000 people - 1,800 Congolese and 1,200 Turks.
The cost of the work is estimated at $290 million, pre-financed by the company, which is also investing $60 million in the hotel which it will manage for 49 years. The finance center is scheduled to be inaugurated on December 2. Before the elections scheduled for the 20th of the same month, in which the current president Félix Tshisekedi is a candidate for a second term.
With its dusty scaffolding, the construction site very close to the new Chinese embassy seems almost to be stalling, and the Chinese workers no longer have the attraction of novelty among the Congolese.
Very present in the country since the time of Mobutu Sese Seko (1965-97), they built the "People's Palace" , the seat of Parliament, and the Martyrs Stadium, an immense enclosure with 80,000 seats.
Under Joseph Kabila (2001-2019), under the terms of a mega-contract "mines for infrastructure", they rebuilt and enlarged large avenues, including the boulevard du 30 Juin, which looks like a highway in the middle of the city.

This project, still in its administrative phase, particularly intrigues the inhabitants of Kinshasa, a chaotic city of 15 million souls where electricity and running water are rare commodities in certain neighborhoods.
