                                                                                    -  
Chinese president Xi Jinping opened the Belt and Road forum in Beijing on Wednesday, with a message that China "can only do well when the world is doing well".
China is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which has extended Chinese economic and geopolitical influence across the globe. 
In his opening speech, Xi promised to extend access to China's market for international firms and for new financing exceeding $100 billion for other developing economies.
He added that two Chinese-backed development banks – the China Development Bank and the Export–Import Bank of China – will each set 350 billion yuan ($47.9 billion) financing windows, while an additional 80 billion yuan ($11 billion) will be injected into the Silk Road Fund to support BRI projects.
"Viewing other’s development as a threat, or taking economic interdependence as a risk will not make one’s own life better or speed up one’s own development," Xi said.
"We have learned that the silk road spirit of peace and cooperation, mutual learning and mutual benefit, openness and win-win is the most important source of strength for the Belt and Road cooperation."
The initiative has deepened China's relations with Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East through large infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, railroads and ports. 
As for China-Africa cooperation, one of the BRI's most significant features is its emphasis on green infrastructure projects and renewable energy development.
Of the representatives from more than 130 mostly developing countries attending the forum, including at least 20 heads of state and government, several African leaders are present. 
Kenyan's President William Ruto and Ethiopia's President Abiy Ahmed, amongst others, are in attendance.

In Beijing this week, the tenth-year milestone of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be marked at a forum that highlights this often-debated model for economic development.
Large signs reading "The Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation" are displayed next to a bustling Beijing road. The previous forums convened in 2017 and 2019.  
This program, championed by China's President Xi Jinping, has provided funding for numerous global infrastructure projects, including ports, power plants, and railways. Nevertheless, the initiative has received criticism for its approach to providing loans to developing nations, which often results in them incurring substantial debt.
Wang Yiwei, the Director of the Institute of International Affairs at China's Renmin University, asserts that BRI encourages a collaborative approach to development with partner nations, providing them with paths to modernization.
Recent events, such as the construction of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in Indonesia, which commenced earlier this month, underscore the mixed reception BRI has encountered. While this 142-kilometer railway significantly reduces travel time between Jakarta and Bandung, it was marred by delays and escalating costs. Originally expected to launch in 2019, disputes over land acquisition, environmental concerns, and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the project. Furthermore, the estimated cost of 66.7 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion USD) ballooned to 113 trillion rupiah ($7.3 billion USD).
Similarly, the $5.9 billion Chinese-built railway linking Laos' capital, Vientiane, to the southern Chinese city of Kunming began operations in 2021, with over 60% of the investment being borrowed – an unusually high percentage for an infrastructure project, according to foreign experts. This has led to the initiative being perceived by some as a "debt trap."
Chinese contractors are also constructing a high-speed rail line from Bangkok to the Laos border, expected to be operational by 2028.
An example of a debt issue emerged earlier this year when a power plant in Jordan, once touted as a groundbreaking project to provide the country with a significant energy source, turned sour. Jordan now finds itself in an international legal battle and billions of dollars in debt to China for a plant that is no longer necessary for its energy needs, due to subsequent agreements made since the project's inception.
A "risk prevention" approach will be critical for the future of the Belt and Road Initiative, given the growing complications in a world marked by ongoing conflicts.
The Belt and Road Initiative Forum is scheduled to commence on October 18.

Street tennis is a new sport recently introduced to Rwandans following the bilateral partnership established between Rwanda and Barbados, a country in the West Indies.
The Rwandan government has always encouraged sports and physical practice and it plans to expand street tennis to different parts of the country.
Often played in recreation areas and residential areas, this sport can also be used to develop tennis skills, organize regional tournaments or attract tourists.
_" This game has the advantage of attracting many people, both Rwandans and foreigners, it can also create opportunities for tourism. The country has many roads in the city of Kigali and around the capital. It's a game that doesn't require a lot of infrastructure, so as long as it's aimed at communities, people are receiving it very positively. "_
Barbados is the home of the famous godfather of tennis, Deighton “Pa” Roach. Road tennis is widely played on the island, and it has already been successfully exported to California, USA. Rwanda is the first African country to host this sport.
"I love playing this very special sport, whenever I find time in the evening I come and play. I love the concept of adopting a new game from another country, it's good to learn something new."
Rwandan sports officials say the game is very affordable and can be played by anyone, provided they have the space.

                                                      Launch of works to build Madagascar's first motorway
                                                                                    -  
Authorities in Madagascar have started works on the country's first motorway linking the capital, Antananarivo, to Tamatave, the country's economic hub and largest port.
Egyptian company Samcrete will be in charge of the 4-year project for a budget of nearly $1 billion.
"The highway will allow us to relieve the congestion of the national road number 2 because in fact it is estimated that the traffic will be multiplied by 5 in the next three years. So it will be unbearable for the national road number 2 to handle this extra traffic", said Public Works Minister of Madagascar, Jerry Hatrefindrazana.
The project has sparked controversy amongst the population. Farmers are one group particularly affected.
"We are in the middle of the rice transplanting period, right at the moment when our rice fields will be destroyed. And we have been waiting for the state to take action for us farmers. In all the speeches, no official spoke about the farmers", complained farmer Roland Edie Rakotodramasy.
Others, like teacher Pauline Ramialisoa, remain convinced about the overall benefits.
"Traffic will be faster, cars will not use much gasoline, and the transport of goods from inside and outside will be more fluid", she said
One of the Egyptian companies involved in the project, EGAAD, stressed the environmental advantages of the new infrastructure.
"This highway that will link the capital to the main port, the economic hub of the country, will ease a lot of things, reducing an 11-hour journey to a 2.5-hour journey. It will help to reduce CO2 emissions by 25 to 30%", claims EGAAD group president, Reda Boulos.
The first stage of the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the president's mandate in 2023.

                                                                                    -  
A new Chinese-built expressway in the Kenyan capital Nairobi will help boost the economy of the African nation, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for transportation and infrastructure, James Wainaina Macharia, said on Saturday.
The expressway opened to traffic for trial runs on Saturday and is expected to increase local employment, ease traffic jams, and bring a raft of economic benefits to the notoriously congested city.
Macharia hailed the expressway as one of the 'best pieces of infrastructure' ever built on the African continent.
"This road will have a very, very big impact in terms of mobility of Kenyans, visitors, businessmen, businesswomen, tourists. This is one of the best pieces of infrastructure ever done in Africa. In fact, it’s the longest expressway in Africa. So we are very proud today (Saturday) to come to witness the start of the trial run and monitor to make sure that indeed the expressway will be operated seamlessly and to a very high standard," he said.
The expressway stretches 27 kilometres through the heart of Nairobi, connecting Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Nairobi's Central Business District, the National Museum and the Presidential Palace.
More than 10,000 people have already registered to use the expressway, with an average of 800 people registering every day.
"Definitely, I will use it often. It's convenient, and hopefully, it will remain like that for the rest of its lifetime," said one Nairobi motorist.
The expressway is already creating direct employment opportunities for Nairobi's workers, with employees at the state-of-the-art expressway monitoring centre welcoming the opportunity to learn new technologies and software that keep the road running smoothly.
"We are doing the traffic monitoring and coping with the automatic detection system. We are able to detect if there is any congestion in the expressway if there is any pedestrian crossing if there is any vehicle reversing in the expressway. And thus, we are able to reach out to the responsible department to handle the abnormality on the expressway. We provide our country with a very smart, smooth and safe and speedy travel experience. We are able to learn a lot of software here as we learnt about the software which enables the cameras. Also, in the monitoring centre, I've learnt some Chinese words," said Martha, an employee working at the expressway monitoring centre.
The 73.5 billion shillings (about $648 million) road is expected to cut travel time from the south to the west of Nairobi to about 20 minutes from two hours currently during peak time.
The expressway was financed and built by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership model. Full-scale construction of the infrastructure project began in September 2020 and was completed a year ahead of schedule.
Building the expressway created more than 6,000 direct jobs, benefiting 200 sub-contractors and hundreds of other local suppliers of building materials such as steel, sand, cement and ballast.

                                                      Kenyan President William Ruto will ask China for a $1 billion loan to complete stalled road projects.
                                                                                    -  
Kenyan President William Ruto will ask China for a $1 billion loan to complete stalled road projects when he travels to Beijing later this month, his deputy Rigathi Gachahua said Friday.
Speaking on local radio Inooro FM, Gachahua said that Ruto will also ask for a longer repayment period for the money that is already owed. 
Ruto's plan is a marked shift in his stance, after his coalition previously criticised his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta's borrowing spree from China.
Unpaid billsKenyatta used the Chinese loans to fund infrastructure projects, such as the Nairobi expressway, but many of these projects have since stalled as contractors abandon them due to unpaid bills. 
"If we get $1 billion we can be able to give these people [contractors] the money they are owed so they can return so even as we pay the debt, the roads are completed," Gachahua said.
The deputy said Ruto will ask Chinese officials if Kenya can be given more time to repay the debts. 
Belt and Road InitiativeKenya was one of many countries on the continent that were a focus of China's Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious project launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping to extend Chinese geopolitical and economic influence through a global infrastructure development push. 
But the surge in Chinese loans to countries like Kenya, before a slowdown in Chinese lending from 2019, has angered critics, pushed up debt loads and the subsequent repayment burden.
The Kenyan government is spending roughly half of its revenue to repay debts that are falling due, official data shows, straining its finances. The situation has been compounded by foreign debt repayments, amid a steep weakening of the Kenyan currency.
The cabinet ordered all ministries to cut 10% of their budget on Tuesday, while the president's office imposed some restrictions on foreign travel by government officials to rein in expenditure.
"It is true that many people have been travelling abroad, spending a lot of money, and that is why the president ordered that even ministers and governors can only travel with two people," Gachagua said.

Congo - Cameroon integration: 312 km road worth $180m operationalized
A 312 kilometre road linking Congolese capital Brazzaville to Yaoundé in Cameroon has gone operational.
The road is part of the integration plan of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), which aims to interconnect the capitals of its eleven member countries.
The asphalt road which cost over $180 million starts from Ketta to Ntam on the Cameroonian border. 90% of it was pre-financed by the African Development Bank
Inaugurating the road, Congolese President, Denis Sassou Nguesso, challenged ECCAS countries to work to better connect the economic community.
“Take the case of Congo, it is connected to Cameroon, we are there. Congo connected to the Central African Republic, we are not there yet. I think we’ll get there. Plans are underway for the Congo to be linked to the DRC thanks to a road-rail bridge over the Congo River.”
The communication route designed to open up the hinterland of the two countries was constructed by Chinese company Sinohydro Tianji Engineering Corporation Ltd.
Méféré Mohamed, a Cameroonian who moved to Sangha 14 years ago, commenting of the development said: “in the past years everything came from Cameroon: nutrition, clothing, textiles in general and not forgetting beer.
“Everything that is agro-food came out of Cameroon for Congo. Today, with the completion of this road, I believe that we will consume both Congo and Cameroon products here in Souanké. I mean products that come from Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire and others that come from Douala and Yaoundé.”
After Gabon in 2014, Cameroon is the second country in the sub-region connected to Congo by an asphalt road.

Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the "best guarantee of development", stressing that "our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km." The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
"China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner," said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
"The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth," he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
"As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities," said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
"This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone," echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

Ivory Coast on Monday commissioned the construction of two major infrastructure projects in the Ivorian economic capital Abidjan- that of a metro and the extension of the international airport. The launch of the construction was attended by the French Economy Minister Bruno le Maire who signed agreements  including credit, for this project.
"The purpose of my visit is obviously to mark the concrete launch of the completion of major infrastructure projects here in Abidjan. " Le Maire said in Abidjan.
"The metro is one of the largest infrastructure projects on the continent. It is an ambitious project, a social project that will benefit millions of people in Abidjan" the French minister added.
At the end of 2019, a French consortium comprising the groups Bouygues Travaux Publics, Alstom, Colas Rail and Keolis had been chosen to build the first metro line in Abidjan.
At the time, France committed to cover the contract with a mix of loans from the French Treasury and private financing guaranteed by the French government. The cost of the work is estimated at 1.36 billion euros. The line will cross the Ivorian metropolis from north to south over 37 km, as far as the airport. The construction work has been delayed for years, but the government hopes that the metro will be operational by 2025.

African Development Bank invests billions in climate change adaptation
The Pokuase motorway interchange in the Ghanaian capital Accra is the first of its kind in West Africa. The flagship road project has dramatically improved regional transport and trade links while also reducing traffic congestion significantly.  
The new road network was one of a number of projects showcased in the city during the African Development Bank's Annual Meetings to highlight the AFDB's efforts to help African economies adapt to climate change. 
The Accra International Conference Center is hosting the Africa Development Bank Annual Meetings where delegates are discussing ways in which the continent can grow despite the effects of the pandemic and global inflation.
SuperhighwayFunded by both the African Development Bank and the Ghanaian government, the Pokuase road project cost $83.9m, or approximately €78m. 
Kwabena Bempong, an engineer on the project, said the new road network has not only helped solve congestion and reduced CO2 emissions, it has also dramatically improved safety on one of Ghana's busiest roads. 
"So this interchange, especially on the N6, takes 50,000 vehicles a day and it has reduced accidents to a very minimum level. It has also improved mobility,,, I'm talking about the entire interchange and the local roads."
In addition to building the new interchange, the project also repaired 10km of road in the area. There was also support for the local community, including IT training for more than 12,000 schoolchildren. Women's groups also received training and had their workplaces renovated. 
PartnershipsThe African Development Bank and African Union once again used this year's event as an opportunity to strengthen international partnerships.
Norway has worked with many African countries for decades. The AFDB and AU are currently working on ways to leverage the Nordic nation's renewable energy and blue economy expertise, while Norway's State Secretary Bjorg Snadkjaer said her country was keen to support Africa's efforts to become food secure. 
"This is a big priority for us to work directly with countries and work through the African Development Bank to support local food production, to support small scale farmers to produce the food to feed themselves, to have food in the belly, but also to sell," insisted Snadkjaer.
Focus on farmingAnother major focus for this year's meeting in Accra was the rollout of a $25 billion (€23 billion) initiative called the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Programme. Over the next five years, it aims to accelerate and improve climate adaptation action across Africa by supporting 30 million smallholder farmers. 
Along with the Pokuase interchange, the African Development Bank has also successfully implemented the Savannah Investment Programme.
The scheme has already helped increase the productivity of farmers in Northern Ghana by more than 350,000 metric tonnes. The project has also thrown its weight behind poultry production, increasing maize and soya production - used in the production of bird feed - from under two metric tonnes to more than six tonnes per hectare. 
The construction of both the new motorway in Accra and the Savannah Programme should significantly improve Ghana's economic productivity. The goal now is to implement similar projects across Africa.

It's a road that will link six African nations, improving transport and delivering high-speed internet across the continent. And at In Guezzam, on the border between Algeria and Niger, the last section of what's been called the African Unity Road is nearing completion.
Conceived over 50 years ago, the Trans-Saharan Highway runs almost 5,000 kilometres from Algiers to Lagos in Nigeria. Its goal is to strengthen regional integration and promote trade between the north and south of the Sahara.
An artery for Algeria"The Trans-Saharan is an economic artery for Algeria in the framework of free trade," says Fayçal Amrouche, Wali of In-Guezzam. "First and foremost it will bring economic benefits and also social benefits for the whole population, which is expecting a lot from it.
"Overall, the residents of In-Guezzam are pleased with this seven-kilometre stretch of road, which is the last section of the African Unity Road on the border with Niger," adds Brahim Ben Khia, President of the Popular Assembly in the Wilaya of In-Guezzam. "It's a construction that's built to international standards."
The RN1 is the main artery between Europe and North Africa. Without the RN1, we're done for!
From Saharan dunes to high plateaus to the capital Algiers, National Road 1, as it's known in Algeria, crosses the country in all its diversity and links remote areas, such as Tamanrasset, the historic meeting place of nomadic caravans, and still a commercial hub, 1900 kilometres from Algiers.
"The Wilaya of Tamanrasset is a crossroads of all African civilisations," says Noureddine Guellal, Director Of Public Works and Wilaya of Tamanrasset. "Barter transactions have increased in recent years. The list of products to be exported and imported is revised each year according to our needs and those of our neighbours."
To cope with this influx, existing sections are being modernised. Following technical studies which took into account the difficult Saharan conditions, their load capacity and width are being increased to ensure safe passage for trucks.
"The RN1 is the main artery between Europe and North Africa," says truck driver Louzri Abderrezak. "Without the RN1, we're done for!"

Internet Cable BackboneBut it's not just roads that connect people. There's also the internet. This road is lined with thousands of kilometres of cable as part of another multinational project: the Trans-Saharan Fibre Optic Backbone.
These technical centres maintain the bandwidth, which has almost doubled over the past two years.
"These are the incoming fibre strands of the trans-Saharan backbone," Bilel Bouglouf, Director Of Post And Telecommunications in the Wilaya Of Tamanrasset, show me. "Their exit towards the borders is through here. Thanks to this trans-Saharan fibre optic backbone, there's the same internet speed in Algiers as in Tamanrasset."
The arrival of fibre optics has enabled the creation of digital schools. This has had a huge impact on pupils' education.
                        Director, Abdelkrim El Meghili Primary Boarding School
The Internet is changing daily life in this large southern city. Credit cards are becoming more widely used in shops. In schools, touch-screen tablets are given to students to encourage creativity and autonomy.
"The arrival of fibre optics has enabled the creation of digital schools," says Ibtissem Merahi, Director of the Abdelkrim El Meghili Primary Boarding School. "This has had a huge impact on pupils' education."
Algeria has completed its part of the fibre optic backbone, more than 2,500 kilometres from Algiers towards Mauritania to a central hub on the border with Niger.
Six African countries are members of the project, which is intended to offer a cheaper alternative to satellite solutions.
"This project will also enable access to the international market for countries that have no coastline, no access to the sea and no submarine cable," says Mourad El-Allia Secretary General Trans-Saharan Liaison Committee. "It allows start-ups and innovation to emerge, and also allows women to showcase their work. It also enables distance learning. It allows us to contribute to the digital development of our African nations."
Another major cooperation project could see the light of day on the same axis: a trans-Saharan gas pipeline between Nigeria and Algeria via Niger.

Kenya: Sand harvestings' dire impact on rivers and aquatic life 
                                                      Sand excavators in Kenya
                                                                                    -  
It's hard to believe that a river flowed through this land in Kenya's Machakos County.
It's just over a hundred miles from the capital Nairobi with its demands as a growing city.
Construction, the need to make glass, cement, concrete and a host of everyday items is what leads the workers and their lorries here.
But the constant excavation of sand n is threatening the environment.
These teams of sand excavators say they are aware of the problem, but there is no system to help them manage the harvesting sustainably.
He says he and others have seen the devastation caused by uncontrolled sand harvesting.
"For our sand, sometimes we excavate to the detriment of our grazing areas, leading to our animals lacking water, but if the government can construct sand catchments so that we can have watering and grazing areas, put regulations where we are supposed to pass while carrying sand and restrict others and construct good roads, it will be a good move," says Mutisya.
"The sand carried from these rivers in a day is in hundreds and thousands of tons because an average semi-trailer can carry 50 tons, (but) there are those for 30 tons and one like mine which is 15 tons. So in a day, it's hard to know the exact (amount) but it's thousands of tons," he adds.
Halinish Yusuf is the Sand Conservation and Utilization Director at Makueni County.
She believes there is a clear need to regulate the industry and to carry out studies to discover whether the resources they have in terms of sand can meet the growing demands.
"Because of the strategic importance of sand being the second most extracted natural resource after water and the importance because of the modernization that is going on, demand from the construction industry, demand from the glass industry and many other industries, there is a need to start thinking about regulating it, recycling, regulating where its harvested, how its harvested, but also thinking about alternatives and also thinking about upscaling and monitoring how its harvested, where, the amounts we have so that we start planning for the future," says Yusuf.
In Kiambu County, a new construction site requires more building materials.
The groundbreaking ceremony to mark a new housing project is cause for celebration, but it could have detrimental consequences for the environment from which the sand is being excavated.
Many rivers in this part of Kenya are bare, and only huge protruding rocks remain.
Lorries excavating sand runs on almost a 24-hour cycle to supply building sites like this one in Kiambu.
Site engineer Samuel Waweru of Vimika Construction has to turn this 20-acre site into a block of residential apartments in the next 18 months.
He argues the regulation of sand supply is a government issue, but he says his crews will also be able to use the rocks to make the necessary building materials.
"About the river sand we don't have data on how much sand is being used but it is in huge figures in terms of millions of tons. In the future because of the environment, we have seen some counties prohibit sand harvesting but in case of sand is prohibited, we have an alternative where we can use rock sand. Rock sand we get it from the ballast, when we are crushing the ballast the byproduct is rock sand which is recommended to use as a substitute for river sand," he says.
According to a recent report by the United Nations Environment Programe (UNEP) sand is the second-largest exploited resource after water.
It says globally, 50 billion tons of sand and gravel are harvested every year.
The conservation group WWF says: "sand mining is already putting unprecedented pressure on rivers, floodplains and deltas," leading to erosion, biodiversity loss and reduced protection from storm surges.
Many communities in Kenya depend on this sort of excavation as their only source of income and as a consequence in some regions, uncontrolled harvesting has led to environmental damage which has been largely overlooked.
According to Yusuf, there needs to be an inventory to understand how much sand is left, what damage has been done and what the demands of the industry will be in the coming years.
She says: "Unfortunately, there is no data to show how much sand is going to be demanded in future development, and by the same token there is hardly any research on the amount of sand deposits that we have. And so, there is, even as we make plans, development plans as governments, we are not able to tell how much sand will be required and if we are running into a crisis or not and so, there is a need to invest in research, to know how much sand deposits we have, how much can be harvested, and how much is needed for development."
Mutisya is aware that his livelihood is already going to have an impact on the supply of water to his family because as the sand disappears and the ground heads underground water supplies are depleted.
He says: "We are saying if the government puts in structures, we will be ready to comply with those restrictions because in doing so we will conserve water for our livestock and even for our own consumption, so that there is a restricted area so that we can conserve the water because we are headed to a very dry season where we will be forced to buy water, even for our livestock."

Senegal and the French group Meridiam, which specialises in the financing and development of infrastructure, announced on Monday that they had signed a contract for the acquisition and management of electric buses in Dakar.
the initiative aims at reducing congestion in this West African metropolis.
The BRT (bus rapid transfer) project, on which work is underway, aims to provide Dakar with electric rapid buses from 2023 onwards, running on exclusive lanes between the suburbs and the city centre, over a distance of more than 18 km, a stretch where traffic is slowed down because of traffic jams.
The investment for the electric buses amounts to 127 billion FCFA (193.6 million euros), according to the Senegalese authorities. The total cost of the BRT project is more than 300 billion FCFA (€450 million) financed by donors such as the World Bank.
Senegal signed the contract with Meridiam and a consortium made up of the French state-owned companies SNCF and RATP, the French transport operator Kéolis and Fonsis, a Senegalese investment fund, said on Monday a statement from the Executive Council for Urban Transport in Dakar (Cetud), a body attached to the Senegalese Transport Ministry.
The 15-year concession contract covers "the acquisition, operation and maintenance of rolling stock and BRT systems". Meridiam announced "the provision of a fleet of 100% electric buses, with batteries, including an initial fleet of 121", in a separate press release. This is a concrete project in favour of energy transition that offers a solution adapted to the challenge of climate change, but also an effective alternative to the existing diesel bus network", it said.
The BRT project also includes the construction of workshops and depots, more than 80 km of roads and pavements to be developed or rehabilitated along the axes served, including intersections, bus stops and terminals. It complements the regional express train (TER) running between Dakar and its suburbs, the first section of which was inaugurated in December.
The two transport systems, BRT and TER, which complement each other with feeder lines, aim to relieve congestion in Dakar, where 0.3% of Senegal's 17 million people live and almost all of the country's economic activities are concentrated. Traffic jams officially cost the city 152 million euros per year.

Ivory Coast: The city of Yamoussoukro in its 40th year as capital 
                                                      Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro
                                                                                    -  
From all four corners of the city, it is impossible to miss it: the immense dome of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro is the symbol of the excessiveness of this city, which is nevertheless struggling to establish itself, at the dawn of its 40th year, as the true capital of Côte d'Ivoire.
With its wide avenues, its large wooded areas, its 1970s architecture and its fluid road traffic, Yamoussoukro, in the peaceful center of Côte d'Ivoire, is unlike any other city in the country.
It is the fruit of a dream, that of the first president of independent Côte d'Ivoire, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, to make his native village of N'Gokro the capital of his country. This was done on March 21, 1983.
Over the course of the 20th century, the village became a real city and inherited a name in homage to Yamousso, the Baule queen and great-aunt of "FHB".
"Félix Houphouët-Boigny first wanted to correct the colonial legacy we had received to stop everything being concentrated in one city (Abidjan)," Jean-Noël Loucou, secretary general of the Félix Houphouët Boigny Foundation, a research institute on peace issues, explained to AFP.
"In creating this capital, the idea was to show the African genius with a particular architecture, without big buildings with a lot of green spaces," he adds.
Forty years later, the city is very large and has some 300,000 inhabitants. But still very few institutions.
The heart of Ivorian politics still beats in the coastal south, in Abidjan, with only the Senate and the National Chamber of Traditional Kings and Chiefs having moved away.
However, there has been no lack of political incantations since the death of the founding father in 1993.
Laurent Gbagbo, president from 2000 to 2011, even launched major construction projects to build a National Assembly and a presidential palace. But the two sites are now abandoned, overgrown with vegetation.
"The will to transfer the capital to Yamoussoukro exists. It is the means that are lacking. As a local authority, we do not have the means to go into international debt, so we are obliged to choose profitable financing that will generate money. But I am hopeful that this will happen one day," the region's governor, Augustin Thiam, told AFP.
"Yamoussoukro is not yet in fact the capital of Côte d'Ivoire. But it is out of the question to create a capital from scratch. There are many things to evaluate, quantify, before moving on to the realization," he adds from the gardens of the residence of President Houphouët, his great uncle.
For the time being, Yamoussoukro remains one of the country's main tourist attractions, thanks in particular to its basilica, inspired by that of St. Peter's in Rome and which is the highest Catholic religious building in the world at 158 meters high.
The Caiman Lake, which borders Houphouët's imposing residence, also attracts the curious who observe the dozens of lizards that bask on the banks, right in the center of town.
"Houphouët tried to build Yamoussoukro little by little around three pillars, education with great schools, religion with the basilica, and tourism. The position of the city is strategic, it is a great crossroads in the center of the country. Everyone passes through here," says Nanan Kouassi Konan, chief of the neighboring village of Kami, one of the "cradles" of the former president.
The saturation and tumult of Abidjan with its 6 million inhabitants could also push more and more Ivorians to go back to Yamoussoukro.
Serge Pokou, a hotelier and farmer, took the step a few years ago with his family.
"I naturally opted for the calm of Yamoussoukro, which is a mix of modern city and countryside, steeped in a preserved African culture. The geometry of the main roads, the lush green spaces, the surprising buildings maintain the calm, the charm and the splendor of the city", he appreciates.
It also remains to build a real economic fabric around the capital beyond tourism. The future creation of an industrial zone is hopeful in this respect.
"We expect economic benefits because the capital must live, so we need activities. The major schools in Yamoussoukro are having trouble retaining their engineers and technicians because there is no industry here," says Jean-Noël Loucou.
"But we must be careful to safeguard the identity of the city and its tranquility, which remain, above all, the criterion of choice for those who live there or who seek to settle there," warns Serge Pokou.

Ivory Coast: The city of Yamoussoukro in its 40th year as capital 
                                                      Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro
                                                                                    -  
From all four corners of the city, it is impossible to miss it: the immense dome of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro is the symbol of the excessiveness of this city, which is nevertheless struggling to establish itself, at the dawn of its 40th year, as the true capital of Côte d'Ivoire.
With its wide avenues, its large wooded areas, its 1970s architecture and its fluid road traffic, Yamoussoukro, in the peaceful center of Côte d'Ivoire, is unlike any other city in the country.
It is the fruit of a dream, that of the first president of independent Côte d'Ivoire, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, to make his native village of N'Gokro the capital of his country. This was done on March 21, 1983.
Over the course of the 20th century, the village became a real city and inherited a name in homage to Yamousso, the Baule queen and great-aunt of "FHB".
"Félix Houphouët-Boigny first wanted to correct the colonial legacy we had received to stop everything being concentrated in one city (Abidjan)," Jean-Noël Loucou, secretary general of the Félix Houphouët Boigny Foundation, a research institute on peace issues, explained to AFP.
"In creating this capital, the idea was to show the African genius with a particular architecture, without big buildings with a lot of green spaces," he adds.
Forty years later, the city is very large and has some 300,000 inhabitants. But still very few institutions.
The heart of Ivorian politics still beats in the coastal south, in Abidjan, with only the Senate and the National Chamber of Traditional Kings and Chiefs having moved away.
However, there has been no lack of political incantations since the death of the founding father in 1993.
Laurent Gbagbo, president from 2000 to 2011, even launched major construction projects to build a National Assembly and a presidential palace. But the two sites are now abandoned, overgrown with vegetation.
"The will to transfer the capital to Yamoussoukro exists. It is the means that are lacking. As a local authority, we do not have the means to go into international debt, so we are obliged to choose profitable financing that will generate money. But I am hopeful that this will happen one day," the region's governor, Augustin Thiam, told AFP.
"Yamoussoukro is not yet in fact the capital of Côte d'Ivoire. But it is out of the question to create a capital from scratch. There are many things to evaluate, quantify, before moving on to the realization," he adds from the gardens of the residence of President Houphouët, his great uncle.
For the time being, Yamoussoukro remains one of the country's main tourist attractions, thanks in particular to its basilica, inspired by that of St. Peter's in Rome and which is the highest Catholic religious building in the world at 158 meters high.
The Caiman Lake, which borders Houphouët's imposing residence, also attracts the curious who observe the dozens of lizards that bask on the banks, right in the center of town.
"Houphouët tried to build Yamoussoukro little by little around three pillars, education with great schools, religion with the basilica, and tourism. The position of the city is strategic, it is a great crossroads in the center of the country. Everyone passes through here," says Nanan Kouassi Konan, chief of the neighboring village of Kami, one of the "cradles" of the former president.
The saturation and tumult of Abidjan with its 6 million inhabitants could also push more and more Ivorians to go back to Yamoussoukro.
Serge Pokou, a hotelier and farmer, took the step a few years ago with his family.
"I naturally opted for the calm of Yamoussoukro, which is a mix of modern city and countryside, steeped in a preserved African culture. The geometry of the main roads, the lush green spaces, the surprising buildings maintain the calm, the charm and the splendor of the city", he appreciates.
It also remains to build a real economic fabric around the capital beyond tourism. The future creation of an industrial zone is hopeful in this respect.
"We expect economic benefits because the capital must live, so we need activities. The major schools in Yamoussoukro are having trouble retaining their engineers and technicians because there is no industry here," says Jean-Noël Loucou.
"But we must be careful to safeguard the identity of the city and its tranquility, which remain, above all, the criterion of choice for those who live there or who seek to settle there," warns Serge Pokou.

                                                                                    -  
China’s chief diplomat was in Cairo Sunday for talks with Egyptian and Arab League officials, marking his last stop in a multi-leg trip to Africa that aims to consolidate Beijing's footprint across the resource-rich continent. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang met with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry.
As well as meeting separately with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit. In a joint news conference, Shoukry said the talks addressed Sino-Egyptian relations and increasing Chinese tourism to the Middle Eastern country, which has for years struggled to revive its vital tourism sector.
Both ministers said they also discussed regional issues including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Tensions have risen after the return to office last month of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is heading Israel’s most right-wing and religiously conservative government.
He also called for “maintaining the status quo” at Jerusalem’s most important holy site, after an ultranationalist Israeli Cabinet minister visited it earlier this year. That visit drew fierce condemnation from across the Muslim world and a strong rebuke from the United States.
In his meeting with el-Sissi, the Chinese foreign minister said Beijing would continue to develop its investment in Egypt’s infrastructure projects including those with links to China’s Belt and Road initiative.
China has invested billions of dollars in Egyptian state-led projects such as the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the new administrative capital, which is being built east of Cairo. Qin arrived in Cairo Saturday afternoon.
His weeklong trip included Ethiopia, where the African Union headquarters is located, as well as Gabon, Angola and Benin. It was Qin's first overseas trip since his appointment in December.
For more than three decades, China’s foreign ministers have started their terms by visiting Africa, whose growing population as a continent rivals China’s.
Beijing has invested heavily in infrastructure in African countries, including roads, energy infrastructure, telecommunications, railways, and hospitals. The Chinese financial groups and funds also gave out $160 billion (USD) in loans to Africa between 2000 and 2020, according to the Chinese Loans to Africa Database.
Amide the coronavirus pandemic, China raced to provide vaccines to Africa, which received only 1% of global COVID-19 vaccine supplies.
China also funded the construction of a new headquarters for the African Center for Disease Control in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa.

                                                      China’s chief diplomat in Cairo Sunday for talks with Egyptian and Arab League officials
                                                                                    -  
China’s chief diplomat was in Cairo Sunday for talks with Egyptian and Arab League officials, marking his last stop in a multi-leg trip to Africa that aims to consolidate Beijing's footprint across the resource-rich continent. Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang met with his Egyptian counterpart Sameh Shoukry.
As well as meeting separately with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi and Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed Aboul-Gheit. In a joint news conference, Shoukry said the talks addressed Sino-Egyptian relations and increasing Chinese tourism to the Middle Eastern country, which has for years struggled to revive its vital tourism sector.
Both ministers said they also discussed regional issues including the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Tensions have risen after the return to office last month of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is heading Israel’s most right-wing and religiously conservative government.
He also called for “maintaining the status quo” at Jerusalem’s most important holy site, after an ultranationalist Israeli Cabinet minister visited it earlier this year. That visit drew fierce condemnation from across the Muslim world and a strong rebuke from the United States.
In his meeting with el-Sissi, the Chinese foreign minister said Beijing would continue to develop its investment in Egypt’s infrastructure projects including those with links to China’s Belt and Road initiative.
China has invested billions of dollars in Egyptian state-led projects such as the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the new administrative capital, which is being built east of Cairo. Qin arrived in Cairo Saturday afternoon.
His weeklong trip included Ethiopia, where the African Union headquarters is located, as well as Gabon, Angola and Benin. It was Qin's first overseas trip since his appointment in December.
For more than three decades, China’s foreign ministers have started their terms by visiting Africa, whose growing population as a continent rivals China’s.
Beijing has invested heavily in infrastructure in African countries, including roads, energy infrastructure, telecommunications, railways, and hospitals. The Chinese financial groups and funds also gave out $160 billion (USD) in loans to Africa between 2000 and 2020, according to the Chinese Loans to Africa Database.
Amide the coronavirus pandemic, China raced to provide vaccines to Africa, which received only 1% of global COVID-19 vaccine supplies.
China also funded the construction of a new headquarters for the African Center for Disease Control in Ethiopia’s capital, Addis Ababa.

Living in darkness: How South Africa's blackout is affecting lives

                                                                                    -

If it is dark at the Mfusis it's because of power cuts. The South African family of five now has to enter power cut mode; meaning: rely on battery torches and candles.
The state-owned power utility is implementing scheduled blackouts. and sometimes gives just a few hours notice. Life has become a rush for the Soweto residents.
"We would come back from school, work and then just, you know, catch up as a family, do...prepare supper, help with homework", Duduzile Mfusi, the mother of three explains. 
"But now have to rush everything. What takes priority is your homework and making sure that everybody eats on time before it gets dark. So, we try to at least make sure that by the time load shedding (power outage) hits, everything is done", she adds.
The Mfusis invested in a generator when power outages only lasted for an hour or two during stage one earlier this year. However, running the generator has become too costly.
"Not having electricity for a period of about 4 hours to 6 hours in a day, it's extremely costly because the generator, also, it's not it's not effective for us in terms of finances", Nhlanhla Mfusi, the father, laments. 
"It's extremely expensive because now you're buying petrol for the generator, you're buying petrol for your car because we have to transport the kids back and forth, back and forth. So we can't afford the generator anymore.''
The public power utility, Eskom, produces 95% of the country’s electricity but struggles to to keep its ageing and poorly maintained coal-fired power stations operational.
As a matter of consequence, supply street furniture like traffic lights, public services including water supply, businesses and households are going without electricity for up to eight hours a day.
To all of them, Eskom asks to use electricity sparingly in order to help prevent nationwide blackouts. 
Bad strategyEconomist Jannie Rossouw, thinks the strategy isn't the good one: "Eskom treats its consumers as if they are the enemies. The sense is as if Eskom is shouting at people: 'You use too much electricity, you're in the wrong.'"
"Eskom should again establish its credibility in civil society with the general public so that civil society and the general public can help support Eskom in its engagement with government to help Eskom overcome the limitations on electricity supply that government has put on Eskom", the economist concludes.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this week cancelled his trip to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly and returned home after the funeral of the Queen Elizabeth II to chair a meeting with his ministers.
According to the official national statistics agency StatsSA, power cuts -referred to by Eskom as load-shedding- were a crucial contributor to the economy contracting by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2022.
Indeed, just about every sector is hurt, and South Africa's biggest telecommunication companies this week warned that continuous blackouts may start affecting their services.
In July, Cyril Ramaphosa announced energy reforms, urging South Africans to "join in a massive rollout of rooftop solar" and sell the excess to the grid. 
He then announced the government, would use climate funding provided through the Just Energy Transition Partnership to invest in the grid and repurpose power stations that have reached the end of their lives.
Last year, the South African authorities raised the licensing threshold for new embedded generation projects from 1 MW to 100 MW.

Living in darkness: How South Africa's blackout is affecting lives

                                                                                    -

If it is dark at the Mfusis it's because of power cuts. The South African family of five now has to enter power cut mode; meaning: rely on battery torches and candles.
The state-owned power utility is implementing scheduled blackouts. and sometimes gives just a few hours notice. Life has become a rush for the Soweto residents.
"We would come back from school, work and then just, you know, catch up as a family, do...prepare supper, help with homework", Duduzile Mfusi, the mother of three explains. 
"But now have to rush everything. What takes priority is your homework and making sure that everybody eats on time before it gets dark. So, we try to at least make sure that by the time load shedding (power outage) hits, everything is done", she adds.
The Mfusis invested in a generator when power outages only lasted for an hour or two during stage one earlier this year. However, running the generator has become too costly.
"Not having electricity for a period of about 4 hours to 6 hours in a day, it's extremely costly because the generator, also, it's not it's not effective for us in terms of finances", Nhlanhla Mfusi, the father, laments. 
"It's extremely expensive because now you're buying petrol for the generator, you're buying petrol for your car because we have to transport the kids back and forth, back and forth. So we can't afford the generator anymore.''
The public power utility, Eskom, produces 95% of the country’s electricity but struggles to to keep its ageing and poorly maintained coal-fired power stations operational.
As a matter of consequence, supply street furniture like traffic lights, public services including water supply, businesses and households are going without electricity for up to eight hours a day.
To all of them, Eskom asks to use electricity sparingly in order to help prevent nationwide blackouts. 
Bad strategyEconomist Jannie Rossouw, thinks the strategy isn't the good one: "Eskom treats its consumers as if they are the enemies. The sense is as if Eskom is shouting at people: 'You use too much electricity, you're in the wrong.'"
"Eskom should again establish its credibility in civil society with the general public so that civil society and the general public can help support Eskom in its engagement with government to help Eskom overcome the limitations on electricity supply that government has put on Eskom", the economist concludes.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this week cancelled his trip to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly and returned home after the funeral of the Queen Elizabeth II to chair a meeting with his ministers.
According to the official national statistics agency StatsSA, power cuts -referred to by Eskom as load-shedding- were a crucial contributor to the economy contracting by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2022.
Indeed, just about every sector is hurt, and South Africa's biggest telecommunication companies this week warned that continuous blackouts may start affecting their services.
In July, Cyril Ramaphosa announced energy reforms, urging South Africans to "join in a massive rollout of rooftop solar" and sell the excess to the grid. 
He then announced the government, would use climate funding provided through the Just Energy Transition Partnership to invest in the grid and repurpose power stations that have reached the end of their lives.
Last year, the South African authorities raised the licensing threshold for new embedded generation projects from 1 MW to 100 MW.

Hotel and helicopters seized, a string of arrests: Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema came to power last year promising to eradicate corruption, and he is fighting an all-out battle to live up to his ambitious commitments, while also drawing criticism.
His first targets were members of the government of his predecessor, Edgar Lungu. The former head of state is accused of having lost his way in heavy infrastructure projects by over-indebting the country, and was also at the head of a government riddled with "serious" corruption, Hichilema said in an interview with AFP in January.
In less than 48 hours this week, two former ministers were arrested. Among them was Given Lubinda, former justice minister and head of the former ruling Patriotic Front (PF) party.
Authorities also seized two helicopters and a hotel belonging to former foreign minister Joseph Malanji. The purchase of these assets is suspected to have been financed with public funds.
The former Minister of the Interior, Stephen Kampyongo, had already been arrested a few months earlier. Not for corruption, but for attempting to crash a helicopter with stones during the 2016 presidential campaign.
In a bankrupt Zambia, plagued by unsustainable debt, per capita GDP is less than 1,000 euros. Four times lower than in neighboring Namibia. But in this country, ranked among the least developed in the world by the United Nations, the fight against corruption involves dizzying amounts of money.
Mr. Lubinda is accused of pocketing nearly half a million euros. Mr. Malanji is accused of embezzling more than one million.
According to investigators, he spent nearly 640,000 euros on a helicopter for an election campaign. Zambia is twice the size of Germany and has few paved roads. The former minister had already been accused last year in another case of having got his hands on more than eight million euros.
These are only the most prominent figures to have been concerned since Hichilema's election in August. A multitude of investigations have been opened. The former head of the postal service, for example, is accused of stealing more than 18 million euros from a fund intended to support the fight against poverty.
"As public officers, we must account for every penny we hold. This is not about persecution but about fighting corruption," government spokeswoman Chushi Kasanda told AFP.
According to Zambian rights activist Brebner Changala, some of the proceedings may have been rushed through: "The authorities are arresting these officials because they want to please the powers that be, that is, President Hichilema," he told AFP.
Transparency International's representative in Zambia, Sampa Kalunga, recently decried on a local radio station a government anti-corruption program that is "disjointed, archaic and does not show results.
Many arrests have ended in bail, with defendants denying the charges and investigations not always well-founded.

Africa's megacities are set back by a lack of modern infrastructure. From Lagos to Kinshasa, Luanda to Abidjan, the demand for bigger roads, metros, bus systems, and bridges far outweighs the investment.
The United Nations recommends that by 2030 countries implement solutions for sustainable urban growth whose mobility is more environmentally friendly. 
To achieve this goal, Angola intends to launch a surface metro for its capital, Luanda.
"[This is] a project of great contribution, to ensure, exactly, that both communities and cities healthier, and also, from the point of view of infrastructure, to bring innovation to our city by solving a major difficulty that is urban mobility," said transport minister Ricardo de Abreu in Luanda.
German transportation company Siemens Mobility will build the light rail under a Public-Private Partnership.   
It is estimated to cover a distance of 149 km at a cost of around 3.5 billion dollars.
Luanda, the capital of oil-rich Angola houses 8 million people. The figure is expected to surge to 12 million people by 2030.
The German government has pledged to help Siemens secure financing for the project. 
Luanda is one of Africa's biggest cities. And traffic gridlocks are common due to a lack of a modern public transportation system.

Gabon: Residence of Moanda town blame flagship project for unfulfilled pladges
A flagship project of the Gabonese government to streamline the economy is now at the centre of controversy.
The Ogooué mineral company, also known as Comilog, which is today the world’s second largest producer of manganese, is being blamed for lack of steering development among the local community around.
Locals in and around Moanda town have pointed out vivid inequalities in terms of development compared to other regions in Gabon. They are now crying foul over lack of basic amenities.
"Here in Comilog's Route Noir, we have no electricity, we have no water, we have no public pumps, and we want to have water and electricity," a resident told AFP journalist.
In 2018, Comilog launched a corporate social responsibility plan aimed at developing the city's infrastructure, rehabilitation of schools, social security coverage and high-speed internet. In 2019, the company announced that it had spent 20 million dollars on these projects.
But the mayor of Moanda confirmed that the projects were not sufficiently funded and therefore did not solve the long term problems in the area.
"Participation efforts have only been going on for two, two and a half years. What has been done is good, but there is still a lot to be done. That means that there are still under-integrated neighbourhoods, that there are secondary roads that are in a lamentable state. Comilog knows this. We think that two years out of fifty or even more is not enough to judge," Bernard Moulonda, Mayor of Moanda said.
Gabon is now the world's second-largest producer of manganese. This ore is mainly used in the manufacture of steel, ceramics, batteries and electronic circuits, and even in the food industry. For example, producing a ton of steel requires 7 kg of manganese – and Comilog produces over 4 million tons of it every year.
