In a lecture room at the Electrical Engineering Department of the Papua New Guinea University of Technology in Lae, Morobe Province, participants of a three-week long ‘Renewable Energy’ Training stood in awe as the lecturer demonstrated how a smart electricity grid works.As the students gathered around the device, the lecturer explained how the grid could simultaneously utilise wind, hydro and solar power to produce clean energy.When one energy source turned off, the others would continue to produce power and ensure continued electricity supply.The lecturer asserted that such grids were key to expanding electricity access in Papua New Guinea, where only 20 per cent of the population currently enjoys regular access to electricity.The training was held under the renewable energy component of the European Union-funded “Support to Rural Entrepreneurship, Investment and Trade” (STREIT) programme, which aims to expand electricity access in the rural areas of East and West Sepik Provinces through renewable energy solutions.As one of the implementing agencies of the programme, UNDP has installed solar photovoltaic systems to schools and health facilities in six sites in the targeted provinces.Over 30 seasoned electricians, engineers, PNG Power employees, and teachers from East and West Sepik Provinces attended the training in Lae to gain the necessary skills to maintain these systems and to become solar energy experts in their respective communities.This marked the third and final training for the participants since 2021. Mr. Wilson Lalu, an electrician with over 40 years of experience, says that the training gave him a new perspective on renewable energy.Mr. Wilson currently works on one of project sites of the STREIT Programme in Nagam, East Sepik Province.Under UNDP’s leadership, the project has installed 176 solar panels and connected them to a battery system that provides continuous power to all dormitories, classrooms and staff houses in a local school.“My involvement at Nagam was during the commissioning of the system. Being an electrician, I had never worked on solar systems like that before. The training has given me a new perspective on the industry,” Mr Lalu said.Computer science teacher and licenced electrician from Vanimo Secondary School Bobby Tagen, also participated in the training. In 2023, UNDP installed a solar photovoltaic system on the school grounds and connected it to the main grid operated by PNG Power.The initiative ensured reliable electricity access to the school’s over 800 students.“The system has been working perfectly since it was installed in 2023. This training taught me about how such systems can be kept running for a longer period of time. This knowledge will help me maintain the system in our school and has motivated me to continue promoting the use of solar power in my community,” Mr. Tagen said.The training was facilitated by the University of Technology’s Sustainable Energy Research Institute (SERI).The Director of SERI, Professor Dapsy Olatona, hopes the training will yield positive results for the communities of the participants.“Our aim is that the participants will return to their villages and take part in installing renewable energy systems, particularly solar systems, in a manner that SERI has taught them.”The Government of Papua New Guinea has set a target of connecting 70 per cent of Papua New Guinea’s population to renewable electricity by 2030. By 2050, the Government hopes to have reached universal electricity access throughout the country.UNDP hopes to contribute to this aim through its various initiatives in the country.In addition to its activities under the STREIT programme, UNDP is currently constructing a one-megawatt solar farm in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.The construction is funded by the Government of Japan and the engineers working on the project will undergo the same training at the PNG University of Technology in Lae.“UNDP is committed to supporting the Government in increasing access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy throughout Papua New Guinea.Without enhancing access to clean energy, we cannot succeed in our efforts to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and enhance environmental sustainability in Papua New Guinea,” stated UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Nicholas Booth, after the training.“The sustainable future of our planet depends on countries making a successful transition onto greener and cleaner forms of energy.The European Union is proud to finance and support this initiative that will enable Papua New Guinea to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and expand electricity access to some of the most vulnerable communities in the country,” added the European Union Ambassador to Papua New Guinea, H.E. Jacques Fradin.

The rural town of Bogia in Madang Province’s far north coast should have been connected to the national electricity grid from the power generated at the Yonki hydro scheme years ago. But this is not the case.
Bogia is linked by a sealed road to the provincial capital, Madang town, about three to four hours’ drive south along the coast on mostly flat land with no mountains or steep hills to negotiate. 
Madang province also shares a land boundary with Eastern Highlands, the province that host the Yonki hydro electricity scheme.
Quite naturally, therefore, Bogia would have been connected to the Yonki electricity supply that lands in Madang town and is extended only to the old Dylup Plantation in neighbouring Sumkar District along the North Coast Road.
Since Bogia was established as a government district administration station in the colonial times, it has depended on electricity generated by a diesel generator. 
The electricity supply from a generator is limited to several hours in a day or night and faces other challenges with maintenance, spare parts and reliability of supply of fuel. 
This is the same situation with many of the 111 districts of Papua New Guinea.
Over the years, Bogia township had to continue with the lack of reliable power supply despite being connected by road to Yonki hydro power scheme via Madang town. You can drive from Bogia town to Yonki hydro scheme in seven to eight hours.
The norm elsewhere on the mainland of PNG has it that electricity power lines follow a provincial or national road that connects a provincial capital and a district administration centre.
Bogia is an electorate that was at one stage, a district agriculture powerhouse with 10 coconut and cocoa plantations, a large cattle ranch and a hotel that have since gone under by the early 2000s, as I shared in the last article.
Member of Parliament for Bogia District, Mr Robert Naguri recalled the economic importance of Bogia in the past through its former plantations of cocoa and coconut when presenting K1million work of machinery and trucks to the revival of one of them, Awar Plantation on Saturday 23 December, 2023. 
Mr Naguri shared his sentiments in Tok Pisin: “Bogia distrik, em ibin holim ekonomi bilong Papua Niu Gini. Yumi ibin gat klostu long ten-pela plentesin insait long Bogia; kakao na kokonas plentesin.
“Yumi nogat gol, yumi nogat kopa, yumi nogat silva, yumi nogat nikel.Tasol Bogia ibin sapotim ikonomi bilong Papua Niu Gini sins 1975 long strong bilong kakao na kokonas.
The plantations of the past were powered by electricity from their own gensats and this will also be the case for Awar, where a large generator is among the machinery bought for its revival.
Bogia district also has many educational, health, community-based organisations, church establishments and the Tupira Surfing site lined up along the coastal road corridor which would have been ready-made clientele for PNG Power.
There is hope for Bogia. On Saturday 23 December 2023, Mr Naguri announced to his people at the district capital that Prime Minister James Marape had just approved K30 million for three stand-alone solar power facilities for the district headquarters and two other sites.
“Two days ago mi sindaun wantaim Praim Minista emi apruvim K30 million sola pawa projek bilong Bogia Distrik; tripela stand-alone sola pawa projeks.”
Mr Naguri said one of the solar power facilities will be located in Bogia town to supply electricity to the district capital, the Holy Spirit Secondary School and the Catholic mission station and surrounding areas. 
The other unit will be set up in Daigul along the main road and the third unit will be for Malala. He said the solar power station in Daigul will power the proposed new hospital and surrounding communities while the one in Malala will supply electricity to Malala Secondary School, Malala primary school, health centre, Catholic mission station and the surrounding communities.
Prime Minister Marape’s commitment of K30 million for the solar power project could not come at a better time for Bogia town alone given the district government putting up new buildings in such as public service accommodation and offices.
The introduction of solar power facilities, the revival of Awar plantation with others to follow and the recent completion of the upgrade and sealing of the north coastal highway from Bogia town towards Awar are some signature projects under Mr Naguri’s watch key projects.
The message from the MP to his people of Bogia on the 23 of December 2023 was straightforward: Forget differences, stop being idle and expect handouts from Waigani but work with his administration to restore Bogia back to its former days. Ends

Chief Meteorologist Jimmy Gomoga yesterday warned the government of cosmic weather patterns which have the potential to cause mayhem in PNG this year.
These are solar flares caused by implosions on the sun’s surface which create heat waves that have been experienced lately around the globe, and which are known to also affect radio transmissions and communications.
Coupled with the severe dry season currently experienced in most parts of PNG, it has the potential to leave many people without food and water in the coming months.The country is currently in its annual wet season period and may experience some rainfall however, according to data collected over the last three months, the rainfall has dropped significantly from an average of 300 milliliters to only 50 milliliters.The heatwaves experienced in Port Moresby and some parts of PNG has caused a sharp increase in temperature which is expected to reach an average high of 37 degrees celsius daily in the coming weeks.“We have seen an increase in solar activity. According to the predictions, it will increase in 2024 and will peak in 2025. It takes about a year before we see the impacts coming on board.“The immediate impact, however, is the increase in temperatures especially the atmosphere and humidity. It becomes very unpleasant and that is what we have been experiencing. Now that El Nino is actually is going to peak and with this solar activity that is going to really amplify the impacts for PNG.” With both the solar flare and El Nino expected to peak in 2025, Mr Gomoga urged the government to start preparing now.“With both phenomena, the impact will be severe. It may not show right now but when it peaks in 2025 it will be big. The government must start preparing now. Tube crops in the highlands will be affected, water sources will dry up affecting electricity generation. Water and food will become scarce. The impact will be bigger than the 1997 drought because the population then was only seven million now it is climbing up to 11 million people,” he said.According to historical data, the highest temperature recorded was 47 Degrees Celsius in Kavieng, New Ireland province which is expected to be beaten. “The temperature across the country has increased generally. For Port Moresby the highest temperature is now 35 degrees but we might go beyond that come January and February. By March we could have things heating up with temperatures going higher as the sun rotates. We are looking at 37 degrees on average and that is hot,” he added.Meanwhile, the El Nino has affected 90 percent of the country over the last three months. Parts of coastal Sandaun, Morobe, East New Britain and West New Britain have experienced severe dry period and this will spread to the rest of PNG until the El Nino peaks in 2025.“The El Nino has different impacts across the country. We will not see this as yet because we are in our wet season. But our rainfall has reduced. The rainfall that will occur during this wet season will not be enough to cater for that. Once we step into our dry season in April and May this year we will see the impacts,” he added.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), under the EU-STREIT PNG Program, has introduced a game-changing and climate-friendly technology, Vanilla Solar Dryers.
This initiative is set to revolutionise the vanilla production process, benefiting over 1,000 rural households across 40 farmer groups in the Sepik region of the country.
These solar dryers, numbering 199 at this stage and distributed across 9 central locations in the Sepik, harness the power of the sun to expedite and enhance the drying process of vanilla beans.
This solar technology is not only eco-friendly but also ensures uniformity in bean quality –– a critical factor for premium-grade vanilla, highly sought after in international markets.
The FAO will continue to support with solar dryers to remaining vanilla producers in the near future.
The solar dryers significantly reduce the curing time while maintaining the size, aroma, and uniform colour of the beans.
Each solar dryer has an impressive capacity, drying 10 kg of vanilla beans every seven days.
Constructed with durability in mind, these dryers have a functional lifespan of up to 5 years, signifying a long-term investment in sustainable vanilla production. A key feature of these solar dryers is their eco-friendly design, thus reducing the carbon footprint associated with vanilla bean processing.
This aligns with global efforts to promote environmentally sustainable agricultural practices.
The prototype of these solar dryers was developed through a collaboration with the Yawasoro TVET Centre in East Sepik Province and a private metal workshop in Wewak, involving local students and technicians.

A solar mini grid will soon be lighting up classrooms, dormitories, and teachers’ housing in Pimaga.Access to the electricity provided through this mini grid will transform the educational experience of young people and teachers at the Pimaga Vocational Education and Training (VET) centre.“For the first time we will have access to power, to support our learning needs, provide a better environment for those students and teachers that live on campus and create a safer environment for everyone, particularly women and girls,” said Warubi Masahimu, manager of the Pimaga VET.The Santos Foundation and SLB (Schlumberger) have entered an exciting new partnership to support the Pimaga VET with a solar mini grid to power the centre.This K1.8 million investment is part of the Santos Foundation’s Youth Opportunities Program focussed on delivering greater outcomes for young people in Kutubu.“Education, training and employment opportunities are core to this program, and we are excited about our partnership with both SLB and the VET centre,” said Senior Projects manager, Anthony Uechtritz.The new investment will mean the students will now have the opportunity to use modern equipment as part of their trade training “to gain hands- on experience and training they would not be able to get otherwise. It means they will be job ready in a competitive market,” added Matt Loth of SLB.Energy poverty is a critical development issue and finding a renewable energy solution for a remote setting is life changing. It will mean better opportunities previously impossible in this community.The Asian Development Bank Energy Sector summary states that PNG has one of the lowest electrification rates in the Pacific, with only 13 per cent of the population having access to electricity.The Santos Foundation is proud to be partnering with SLB and the Pimaga VET centre on this project and believes the contribution will make a lasting impact on the local community that access the VET centre and look forward to seeing the benefits of this project in the years to come.

Puma Energy Papua New Guinea has officially commissioned a solar project at its Napanapa Refinery, marking a milestone for the company’s solarisation journey, not only in PNG but also globally.The project, which took four months to build, saw the installation of 684 solar panels at the Napa Napa Refinery, outside Port Moresby.This new setup can deliver 300KW of solar power, producing 485.5 MWh of energy per year, which will help modernise and reduce the facility’s CO2 emissions.The development is a key part of Puma Energy’s sustainability strategy to reduce its operational GHG emissions.The company has set a sustainability target to reduce its global operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 15 per cent by the end of 2025 and by 35 per cent by the end of 2032.The solar project at Napa Napa refinery complements Puma Energy’s global program to connect its Puma branded retail stations and other sites to solar energy.
The company has already connected more than 250 Puma branded retail stations to solar energy, and is planning to connect 300 by the end of 2023.In total, the company has now installed 8875 MW of solar energy generation capacity across its operations. Alongside the solar capacity Puma Energy has already installed across its network, this project will allow Puma to apply the expertise gained through this installation to offer similar renewable solutions to our commercial customers in Papua New Guinea.This will mean they can benefit from reduced energy costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and a reliable supply of energy.Papua New Guinea company chairman and managing director, Hulala Tokome said: “We are proud that Puma Energy PNG has launched the company’s biggest solar project in the region. It highlights our firm long-term commitment to operating sustainably and responsibly in the country.”“Papua New Guinea’s enhanced nationally determined contribution sets out ambitious plans to reduce its carbon emissions by half by 2030 and be entirely carbon neutral by 2050. This project fully supports these goals and, by helping our customers to install similar renewable energy solutions, Puma Energy can play a major role in helping the country meet these environmental commitments and promote energy security.“Our ambition is to fulfil our purpose of energising communities while supporting the energy transition and reducing our environmental impact.”

BY FRANCO NEBASThe Morobe Provincial Government has signed an agreement with a Dubai-based company to build a solar power in the province.Morobe Governor Luther Wenge announced this when signing a memorandum of agreement with Dubai-based AstralENERGY.
Mr Wenge said power outages was a legacy issue to the people of Lae and Morobe for years.He said the issue was never being addressed by the past successive governments up until today.“Morobe is now looking towards Dubai to supply and installed two solar power plants possibly in Lae and Huon Gulf districts,” he said.
He said AstralENERGY has been engaged under the private investment programs arranged by the Morobe Provincial Government.To facilitate the finance and construction of the Energy Impact Projects or programs, such as with solar, hydro and geothermal power plants, are one of the key policies for this government,” he said.The solar power plants will be built and installed at two different locations.
“One will be located at Labu supplying power to the main industrial centres including the wharf and market areas while the other one to be built behind Martin Luther Seminary supplying Malahang Industrial centre and surrounding areas,”he said.The total capacity which to be generated shall be of 100 megawatt that capable to supply power to the city.Mr Wenge said the total cost of the project is K250 million and will be 50 per cent counter-funding between the AstralENERGY and Government of PNG through the Private Investment Program. The project will generate huge income for the province as the power will be sold at half price charged by PNG Power Limited.The company engaged by MPG as a partner in this economical viable project is AstralENERGY Project Management Services in PNG.It is a Dubai-based company but since having joint venture partners with provinces and government of PNG in such magnitude projects in its specialities, the company has then incorporated under the Investment Promotion Authority and in the process of establishing.AstralENERGY chief executive officer Richard Peter said the project is expected to commence before the end of June 2023.

The US government, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and Santos bring electricity to a rural community in Southern Highlands Province.In partnership with the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority, Santos through the Santos funded Oil Search Foundation (OSF) and USAID launched the Pimaga Rural Hospital Solar Electrification Project on March 28, at Pimaga, in Nipa Kutubu district, Southern Highlands Province.The mini grid installed through the project will now serve not only hundreds of patients seen at the clinic but will also provide power to the dozen or more clinic staff and their families who live on the compound.
Enhanced electrical capacity at the clinic will keep patients more comfortable, as well as allowing clinicians to carry out medical treatments more reliably and safely.Santos country chair PNG, Leon Buskens said the use of renewable energy such as solar demonstrates Santos’ Vision 2040 to be a leading global provider of clean fuels and investing in carbon reduction initiatives.“This collaboration with USAID and the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority (SHPHA) to bring electricity through the solar mini grid project will go a long way in providing a much-needed source of cheap, economically viable, and sustainable form of energy source,” Mr Buskens said.
Santos Foundation’s chief programs officer, Jean Martin said the Foundation is committed to working with their partners like SHPHA and the district development authority to strengthen the systems that enhance service delivery.“Reliable clean energy will improve service delivery at Pimaga Rural Hospital, and we are pleased to have been able to partner with USAID PEP to undertake this piece of work,” she said.The mini-grid project was supported through USAID’s Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership (USAID-PEP) Activity, a five-year project in partnership with the Government of PNG that will contribute to the goal of connecting 70 per cent of PNG’s population to electricity by 2030.

Women’s Micro Bank (Mama Bank) in partnership with Sun King and NGF Solar distributor has launched its solar loan product in Port Moresby yesterday.The partnership will see solar products offered on loan through Women’s Micro Bank to support women, particularly in rural areas and their families to address one of the day to day challenges they face related to lack of electricity, and access to various other livelihood activities.The loan product will be piloted in Mama Bank’s Wewak branch and nine other agencies called Mama-Bank Access Points (MAPs) in the 10 districts of the Greater Sepik region.
Sun King Solar Products is a world renown solar product distributor based in India and has been operating in partnership with solar distributors in PNG, including the NFG and Solar Solutions since 2018.Sun King PNG country manager, Andrew Tegete said the main mission of Sun King is to get the solar to the untouched population of PNG.“We are tasked to be partnering with Women’s Micro Bank because they have branches in PNG,” he said. “Through those branches, we can get the products to the untouched population of PNG.
That is the main aim for us, Sun King and NGF and Women Micro Bank partnering together.”As part of the partnership, Sun King will be focusing on three of its products including SK Pro400, HK Home 200x and the SK 16inch fan.Women’s Micro Bank chief executive officer, Gunanidhi Das thanked the development partners in the likes of USAID-PEP Project, DFAT’s Pawarim Komuiniti Program, MFAT, ADB, UNDP and others who have supported the National Government’s development initiatives in accessing off-grid electrification, and for working in collaboration with all stakeholders, which Mama Bank is no exception.
“That has enabled Mama Bank to tap into green financing as a potential implementing partner, hence, is bringing to the market its potential for microfinance solar loan,” Mr Das said.“Mama Bank realised that access to clean energy can catalyse PNG’s unified and inclusive development and that access to energy is a primary driver for rural development.”

The National Energy Authority has chosen solar energy infrastructure, including roof-tops and solar farms, as the best option for New Ireland Province’s electricity needs.NEA as part of its National Electricity Roll Out Plan (NEROP) has visited New Ireland Province where it held talks with the provincial management team on how both team will work to improve electricity supply to the province.NEA managing director, Ronald Meketa said the challenges for NIP and provinces with many isolated islands is the difficulty of running transmission lines from the main grid across the seas.
He said the best option for such inaccessible islands is for solar energy infrastructure including roof-tops and solar farms but that does not rule out the option of underwater transmission lines.“As long as the stakeholder, especially provincial governments are willing, NEA can assist in making that a reality, and reaffirms the NEA’s position,” he said.One of the options that was left open for discussion was whether NIP could access the excess power produced by Newscrest Lihir’s geothermal power installation that is used for its operation.
PNG has some of the most rugged and difficult terrains in the world, hundreds of its island villages are as isolated as compared to the remote villages in the highlands.Mr Meketa said this was primarily the reason why the government in 2017 adopted the National Energy Policy and is presently driving the electricity agenda through the NEA to implement the NEROP.“This year the NEC approved the Special Steering Committee for NEROP comprising of secretaries of the DNPM, Treasury and PNG Power Ltd with NEA taking the leading role,” he said.
“The NEA is primarily the state regulator of the electricity supply services and downstream gas industry and is also the policy maker of renewables in PNG.”However, Mr Meketa said, NEA is also filling the gap regarding the implementation aspects of driving projects by providing stakeholders, especially provincial governments with technical support, advisory roles in differing policies, and legal advice, and talking with project partners including multi-donor agencies to partner in power generation, transmission, power purchase agreements in areas where PPL cannot provide reliable grid and power, among others.NEA is now working with the government to begin its first pilot project for islands in PNG to provide rooftop and standalone solar panels starting with NIP.

The Mineral Resources Authority will save about 60 per cent of its annual energy bills averaging about K650,000 with the launching of its new photo-voltaic (PV) solar power system.The PV solar power system was launched yesterday at the Mining Haus by chairman of the MRA board, Benny Kimisive and officer-in-charge (OIC) Nathan Mosusu.The grid-tie system installed on the roof-top of the Mining Haus has a capacity of 162 kilowatts.
It will be used as a power source, which will operate concurrently with the PNG Power Limited (PPL) grid to supply the building’s power demand of about 250 kW.The system is designed to operate at optimum with the balance of the building’s power demand to be supplied by the PPL utility grid.This will have a great effect on the final electricity bills.
The project has been installed in partnership with PPL.It is part of PPL’s project called the “roof-top solar photovoltaic pilot project”.Mr Mosusu, while officiating at the event, said the project is a demonstration of MRA’s commitment towards achieving the government’s national strategic development plan of generating 25 per cent of electricity from renewable resources by 2030.
He said they have been relying on fossil fuel for electricity and that this was the beginning of a paradigm shift towards doing things smarter using greener technology, and solar energy is a step in the right direction.“In 2018 alone, PNG imported about 42,000 barrels of fossil fuel oil and MRA’s new power source would contribute to the reduction in these statistics,” Mr Mosusu said.“The OIC said the biggest share of the 42, 000 barrels of oil, would no doubt, be attributed to the power requirements of the mining industry.“As the regulator, we at MRA must set the standards in reducing our carbon footprint, so that the industry can hopefully follow suit.”Board chairman, Mr Kimisive, said the board had been supportive of this project since its inception, adding that this would greatly reduce MRA’s power cost.He said there were more of such projects in the pipeline and the board would continue to support MRA’s management in achieving these projects.PNG Power Limited CEO Obed Batia said in a statement that the initiative of roof-top solar PV project is part of the organisation’s Pacific Renewable Energy Advisory Project, which is supported by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).He said under this project, 10 organisations were participating, including MRA, adding that MRA was the first participant to have successfully installed the system.

TOKYO: Japan’s Moon lander has resumed operations after being shut for a week due to a power supply issue.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said it re-established contact with the lander Sunday night, indicating that the glitch had been fixed.Its solar cells are working again after a shift in lighting conditions allowed it to catch sunlight, the agency said.It could not generate power when it landed on 20 January as the solar cells pointed away from the sun.With the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (Slim) spacecraft, Japan became only the fifth country to achieve a soft touchdown on the moon after the US, the former Soviet Union, China and India.The spacecraft ran on battery power for several hours before authorities decided to turn it off to allow for a possible recovery of electricity when the angle of sunlight changed.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Jaxa shared a photograph taken by Slim of a nearby rock that it said resembled a toy poodle.The lander will analyse the composition of rocks in its search for clues about the origin of the moon, Jaxa said.Slim landed at the edge of an equatorial crater known as Shioli, within 55 m (180 ft) of its target in a crater. Jaxa described it as an “unprecedented pinpoint landing”.

NiuPower Ltd has donated 118 solar kits to the Gorohu village in the Central Province.
NiuPower chief executive officer Michael Uiari said access to electricity is one of the country’s biggest priorities with the government’s aim to cover 75 per cent of the country’s rural population by 2030.
“On behalf of NiuPower and its shareholders, Kumul Petroleum and Santos, we are pleased to extend the support to Gorohu and its surrounding communities. 
We have donated 118 solar kits so that they have lights,” Mr Uiari said.
“These communities are important to us. We have the PNGLNG and we have been operating since 2019, and as part of our program we have extended some of what we do to the community here.
“They are isolated and that’s what touched me, so we were able to provide solar kits so they can have light.”
Mr Uiari said the rest is up to the other businesses like the Telco’s who can set up towers: “They already have 118 households who will be connected as customers.
“When you have electricity it opens the pathway to other services, which is an example of what can be done on the back of electricity.”
Mr Uiari highlighted that NiuPower has so far, through its various community programs, invested around K4.5 million.
“Since 2019 we have invested about K4.5 million across our project area footprint covering five areas.”
