She shared her deep connection with Jamnagar and her love for Anant Ambani. Radhika witnessed the birth of a baby elephant and praised Anant's project Vantara. They are excited for their wedding in Jamnagar. Radhika Merchant and Anant Ambani  On Day 1 of their lavish three-day pre-wedding celebrations in Jamnagar, to-be bride and Ambani bahu, Radhika Merchant expressed her love and gratitude for all members of the Ambani family. While she called Nita Ambani an inspiration, she shared that Mukesh Ambani is a father-figure to her. Moreover, she also shared her love for Anant Ambani-- her life-partner and how they build their relationship over the years in Jamnagar.Radhika Merchant said, "For Anant and me, Jamnagar is where our heart is. This is where we grew-up, where we became friends, where we fell in love, and where we built our relationship. Now as we begin our future together, we will be doing it here, and we are so thankful when you get to see the beginning of it. This place has become a part of our fondest memories, my deepest secrets, our loudest laughs, and the happiest times that we have had together as a family. It has seen us go through all our ups and downs."Sharing a lesser-known detail about their relationship, Radhika further said, "In March of 2020, Anant and I got locked down here and we couldn't go back to see our families for months. Although it was hard to stay away, we learnt to appreciate the small joys of life. But in Jamnagar, and with Anant, the small joys are a once in a lifetime experiences. One day we got a call saying one of our rescued elephants was giving birth. Since she was brought up in captivity she was extremely stressed by the process. I watched as Anant stood there with the mahavat, through an eight-hour labour process, calmly talking to her. Now we have a beautiful baby Hanuman, who is almost four-years-old and is as naughty as ever."Talking about Anant's ambitious project Vantara and how she has seen it shape over the years, Radhika said, "People ask me when did Anant start Vantara? I don't think there is any start date. It has always just been in his heart. He has been able to formalise this institution more over the years. I have had the privilege of watching Anant and his team pour their hearts and souls into making this vision a reality. Anant, I will never be able to express how proud I am of you."Radhika then expressed her love for Anant, whom she is all set to marry on July 12, 2024. Talking of love and marriage, Radhika said, "Someone once told me what do you really find when you find a partner. What you really find is somebody to witness your life. There are over a billion people on this Earth and what does one life really mean? But when you find somebody, you find somebody to promise you to care about everything-- the good, the bad, the beautiful, the bold, the sad, and the mundane. You say, 'I will see you everyday. Your life will not go unnoticed because I will witness it'. Anant, I am so blessed to be a witness to your beautiful life." She added, "Anant and I are so blessed to have you here in Jamnagar. It is an example of how expansive the Indian industry could be, how expansive a human heart can be. Anant's grandfather, Shri Dhirubhai Ambani, dreamt of opening the world's largest refinery here, Mukesh uncle executed this dream with precision, and Nita aunty built a vibrant township and a green belt which was once a barren land. This gave Anant the world's greatest canvas to fulfil his passions. Three generations of our family have worked together and dedicated themselves to Jamnagar, and we feel so humbled to be able to share it with you all today. Thank you once again for being a part of our celebrations. I hope the grace, beauty and magic of Vantara touches your hearts like it has ours."Anant and Radhika formally got engaged in January 2023, after knowing each other for a few years. Radhika Merchant is the youngest daughter of Encore Pharmaceuticals' CEO Viren Merchant and his wife Shaila Merchant. On Day 1 of their lavish three-day pre-wedding celebrations in Jamnagar, to-be bride and Ambani bahu, Radhika Merchant expressed her love and gratitude for all members of the Ambani family.
