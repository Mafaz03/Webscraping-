The third China-Africa economic and trade expo on the theme of common development for a shared future concluded on Sunday in Changsha city, with 10.3 billion U.S. dollars’ worth of projects signed.

The expo aimed to boost business links between both parties while opening the Chinese market to products Made in Africa.  
"The economic and trade cooperation between China and Africa has been expanding from traditional trade and engineering construction to digital, green and financial fields. In particular, the import of agricultural products from Africa shows great cooperation potential. All of these have strongly promoted the high-quality development of economic and trade cooperation between the two sides," shared Wang Dong, deputy head, Department of Western Asian and African Affairs, Chinese Ministry of Commerce.
The four-day event has attracted over 100 000 visitors and resulted in 74 cooperative projects, a first in the expo's five-year history, according to statistics from the organizing committee.

"Chinese equipment and machines are helping African people innovate and start businesses, change their lives, and make their lives more beautiful," told a Buyer from Benin. 
The China-Africa economic and Trade expo is committed to building a new mechanism for China-Africa economic and trade cooperation, a new platform for the implementation of economic and trade initiative and a new window for Sino-African economic and trade cooperation at the sub-national level.

In Beijing this week, the tenth-year milestone of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be marked at a forum that highlights this often-debated model for economic development.
Large signs reading "The Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation" are displayed next to a bustling Beijing road. The previous forums convened in 2017 and 2019.  
This program, championed by China's President Xi Jinping, has provided funding for numerous global infrastructure projects, including ports, power plants, and railways. Nevertheless, the initiative has received criticism for its approach to providing loans to developing nations, which often results in them incurring substantial debt.
Wang Yiwei, the Director of the Institute of International Affairs at China's Renmin University, asserts that BRI encourages a collaborative approach to development with partner nations, providing them with paths to modernization.
Recent events, such as the construction of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in Indonesia, which commenced earlier this month, underscore the mixed reception BRI has encountered. While this 142-kilometer railway significantly reduces travel time between Jakarta and Bandung, it was marred by delays and escalating costs. Originally expected to launch in 2019, disputes over land acquisition, environmental concerns, and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the project. Furthermore, the estimated cost of 66.7 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion USD) ballooned to 113 trillion rupiah ($7.3 billion USD).
Similarly, the $5.9 billion Chinese-built railway linking Laos' capital, Vientiane, to the southern Chinese city of Kunming began operations in 2021, with over 60% of the investment being borrowed – an unusually high percentage for an infrastructure project, according to foreign experts. This has led to the initiative being perceived by some as a "debt trap."
Chinese contractors are also constructing a high-speed rail line from Bangkok to the Laos border, expected to be operational by 2028.
An example of a debt issue emerged earlier this year when a power plant in Jordan, once touted as a groundbreaking project to provide the country with a significant energy source, turned sour. Jordan now finds itself in an international legal battle and billions of dollars in debt to China for a plant that is no longer necessary for its energy needs, due to subsequent agreements made since the project's inception.
A "risk prevention" approach will be critical for the future of the Belt and Road Initiative, given the growing complications in a world marked by ongoing conflicts.
The Belt and Road Initiative Forum is scheduled to commence on October 18.

Kenyan President William Ruto arrives in China for Belt and Road Forum
                                                      Kenya's President William Ruto poses during a photo session at the Palais Brongniart for the New Global Financial Pact Summit in Paris on June 22, 2023.
                                                                                    -  
Kenyan President William Ruto has arrived in Beijing to participate in the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, scheduled for two days in the Chinese capital.
This forum holds great diplomatic significance for China, as it's the most important event of the year and a notable celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
Over 140 countries and 30 international organizations, including leaders, officials, and representatives from various sectors, have confirmed their participation.
The Belt and Road Initiative, initiated by China in 2013, aims to create trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia, Europe, Africa, and beyond along the historic Silk Road trade routes.
In the past decade, over 150 countries and 30 international organizations have engaged with the BRI framework, marking a significant milestone in global cooperation.
William Ruto intends to ask China for a $1 billion loan and a debt repayment restructuring plan, the country's vice-president said on Friday.
According to Rigathi Gachagua, the head of state, who criticized his predecessor's heavy borrowing from Beijing, will visit China at an unspecified date. He will ask for "more time to slowly repay the debt", as well as a billion dollars to complete road projects delayed by lack of funding.
Kenya, one of East Africa's largest economies, has accumulated more than $68 billion in debt, equivalent to 67% of its gross domestic product.
"We are a responsible government, we can't say we won't pay the debt," Rigathi Gachagua told a local radio station.
China, which William Ruto has not visited since his election in August 2022, is the country's second-largest creditor, after the World Bank.
In Mombasa, East Africa's largest port on the Kenyan coast, it is financing the construction of a new terminal.
Beijing has also lent $5 billion (€4.7 billion) for the realization of the most expensive infrastructure project since the country's independence in 1963: the train line that since 2017 has linked the port city of Mombasa to Naivasha, in the Rift Valley, via the capital Nairobi.
During the election campaign, William Ruto had denounced the loans of his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta, pledging to find other ways of stimulating development to build the country's necessary infrastructure.
China has rejected criticism that its lavish loans are plunging some countries, particularly in Africa, into debt overload.
During a visit to Kenya in July, Beijing's head of diplomacy, Wang Yi, praised bilateral cooperation and a "win-win" partnership.
Despite a dynamic economy, around a third of Kenya's population lives in poverty.
Economic growth slowed to 4.8% last year, from 7.6% in 2021, hit by the global fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a devastating regional drought that hit the country's vital agricultural sector.
Inflation remained high, at an annual rate of 6.8% last month.
In July, global ratings' agency Fitch Ratings downgraded Kenya's ability to repay international lenders from "stable to negative", citing tax hikes and social unrest.

                                                      Launch of works to build Madagascar's first motorway
                                                                                    -  
Authorities in Madagascar have started works on the country's first motorway linking the capital, Antananarivo, to Tamatave, the country's economic hub and largest port.
Egyptian company Samcrete will be in charge of the 4-year project for a budget of nearly $1 billion.
"The highway will allow us to relieve the congestion of the national road number 2 because in fact it is estimated that the traffic will be multiplied by 5 in the next three years. So it will be unbearable for the national road number 2 to handle this extra traffic", said Public Works Minister of Madagascar, Jerry Hatrefindrazana.
The project has sparked controversy amongst the population. Farmers are one group particularly affected.
"We are in the middle of the rice transplanting period, right at the moment when our rice fields will be destroyed. And we have been waiting for the state to take action for us farmers. In all the speeches, no official spoke about the farmers", complained farmer Roland Edie Rakotodramasy.
Others, like teacher Pauline Ramialisoa, remain convinced about the overall benefits.
"Traffic will be faster, cars will not use much gasoline, and the transport of goods from inside and outside will be more fluid", she said
One of the Egyptian companies involved in the project, EGAAD, stressed the environmental advantages of the new infrastructure.
"This highway that will link the capital to the main port, the economic hub of the country, will ease a lot of things, reducing an 11-hour journey to a 2.5-hour journey. It will help to reduce CO2 emissions by 25 to 30%", claims EGAAD group president, Reda Boulos.
The first stage of the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the president's mandate in 2023.
                                                                                    01:00

                                                                                    -  
A new Chinese-built expressway in the Kenyan capital Nairobi will help boost the economy of the African nation, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for transportation and infrastructure, James Wainaina Macharia, said on Saturday.
The expressway opened to traffic for trial runs on Saturday and is expected to increase local employment, ease traffic jams, and bring a raft of economic benefits to the notoriously congested city.
Macharia hailed the expressway as one of the 'best pieces of infrastructure' ever built on the African continent.
"This road will have a very, very big impact in terms of mobility of Kenyans, visitors, businessmen, businesswomen, tourists. This is one of the best pieces of infrastructure ever done in Africa. In fact, it’s the longest expressway in Africa. So we are very proud today (Saturday) to come to witness the start of the trial run and monitor to make sure that indeed the expressway will be operated seamlessly and to a very high standard," he said.
The expressway stretches 27 kilometres through the heart of Nairobi, connecting Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Nairobi's Central Business District, the National Museum and the Presidential Palace.
More than 10,000 people have already registered to use the expressway, with an average of 800 people registering every day.
"Definitely, I will use it often. It's convenient, and hopefully, it will remain like that for the rest of its lifetime," said one Nairobi motorist.
The expressway is already creating direct employment opportunities for Nairobi's workers, with employees at the state-of-the-art expressway monitoring centre welcoming the opportunity to learn new technologies and software that keep the road running smoothly.
"We are doing the traffic monitoring and coping with the automatic detection system. We are able to detect if there is any congestion in the expressway if there is any pedestrian crossing if there is any vehicle reversing in the expressway. And thus, we are able to reach out to the responsible department to handle the abnormality on the expressway. We provide our country with a very smart, smooth and safe and speedy travel experience. We are able to learn a lot of software here as we learnt about the software which enables the cameras. Also, in the monitoring centre, I've learnt some Chinese words," said Martha, an employee working at the expressway monitoring centre.
The 73.5 billion shillings (about $648 million) road is expected to cut travel time from the south to the west of Nairobi to about 20 minutes from two hours currently during peak time.
The expressway was financed and built by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership model. Full-scale construction of the infrastructure project began in September 2020 and was completed a year ahead of schedule.
Building the expressway created more than 6,000 direct jobs, benefiting 200 sub-contractors and hundreds of other local suppliers of building materials such as steel, sand, cement and ballast.

Congo - Cameroon integration: 312 km road worth $180m operationalized
A 312 kilometre road linking Congolese capital Brazzaville to Yaoundé in Cameroon has gone operational.
The road is part of the integration plan of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS), which aims to interconnect the capitals of its eleven member countries.
The asphalt road which cost over $180 million starts from Ketta to Ntam on the Cameroonian border. 90% of it was pre-financed by the African Development Bank
Inaugurating the road, Congolese President, Denis Sassou Nguesso, challenged ECCAS countries to work to better connect the economic community.
“Take the case of Congo, it is connected to Cameroon, we are there. Congo connected to the Central African Republic, we are not there yet. I think we’ll get there. Plans are underway for the Congo to be linked to the DRC thanks to a road-rail bridge over the Congo River.”
The communication route designed to open up the hinterland of the two countries was constructed by Chinese company Sinohydro Tianji Engineering Corporation Ltd.
Méféré Mohamed, a Cameroonian who moved to Sangha 14 years ago, commenting of the development said: “in the past years everything came from Cameroon: nutrition, clothing, textiles in general and not forgetting beer.
“Everything that is agro-food came out of Cameroon for Congo. Today, with the completion of this road, I believe that we will consume both Congo and Cameroon products here in Souanké. I mean products that come from Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire and others that come from Douala and Yaoundé.”
After Gabon in 2014, Cameroon is the second country in the sub-region connected to Congo by an asphalt road.

DRC: Cobalt, Copper, cross-border transport nightmare | Africanews

The heavy load of copper cathodes is secured, the Howo semi-trailer is ready to travel the 2,000 km or so from the mines in Haut-Katanga to the port of Dar es Salaam, from where the cargo will be shipped to Asia.
"It can take two weeks to make the trip," complains Omar Rachidi Katema, a 57-year-old Tanzanian truck driver who has just loaded 27 tons of copper plate at the Chemaf (Chemicals of Africa) plant at the Etoile mine site in Lubumbashi, in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
"There are a lot of traffic jams, a lot of tolls, a lot of waiting at the border," says the trucker.
The plates (cathodes) are firmly attached in bundles, each weighing 2.3 tons. "To avoid theft" during transport, explains Eric Tshinkobo, copper manager at the plant.
At the London Metal Exchange (LME) price, a ton of copper costs about $10,000.
But if the goods are spared, the drivers are not, especially on the Congolese portion of the route. "Thieves attack us, especially on the Lubumbashi bypass road," says Omar Rachidi.
"Between here and the Zambian border (about 80 km), bandits attack us, rip off the tarpaulins, take away our money," also laments Jacob Daoudi, 45, another Tanzanian trucker, who transports 30 tons of cobalt hydroxide in his Scania.
To avoid drivers carrying too much cash, operators are increasingly resorting to prepayment, via a bank, of the substantial sums to be paid at the toll booths along the road from Kolwezi, another major mining town in neighbouring Lualaba province, to Kasumbalesa, on the border with Zambia.
There are six toll booths along the 400 km of this strategic route," said Lambert Tshisueka Mutondo, president of the international road transporters of Haut-Katanga, affiliated with the Federation of Congolese Companies (FEC). This situation "hinders the flow of traffic and the profitability of the sector", he says.
He also deplores the tariffs charged: to cover these 400 km, heavy goods vehicles pay some 500 dollars, or 1,000 dollars round trip, ten times more expensive on average, according to him, than on the roads of southern Africa.
The tolls on this section are conceded by the Congolese state to a Chinese company which, in return, undertakes to ensure the construction and maintenance of road infrastructure.
The issue is sensitive and regularly debated, with one NGO recently denouncing the "leonine" nature of this type of contract. The Congolese Association for Access to Justice (Acaj) was surprised that after 14 years of concessions, the DRC still does not have a highway.
The government firmly disputes this analysis and asserts that these concessions, which it wants to extend, have enabled the construction and rehabilitation of many roads.
Compared to the average state of the Congolese road network, National Road 1, which crosses "greater Katanga", is good, paved and without deep potholes. But it has only two lanes, one for each direction of traffic.
Upstream of the Kanyaka tollbooth, halfway between Lubumbashi and the border, more than 200 semi-trailers are at a standstill, waiting to complete the mandatory formalities.
"In the Congo, there are red tape all the time," says Maniasi Djuma Makweba, 50, also on his way to Dar es Salaam with 35 tons of cobalt loaded at TFM (Tenke Fungurume Mining), 300 km away.
Like the other drivers, he complains about thieves, but also about the military and police. "When you go to the police to report a theft, they start by trying to extort money from you," the trucker says.
The Upper Katanga transporters' guild is calling for "patrols to deter criminals", as well as for the number of toll booths to be halved, for prices to be "capped according to the distance to be covered" and "harmonized" between the DRC and neighboring Zambia.
In fact, "by reciprocity", Zambia makes Congolese trucks pay a high price when crossing its territory and thus loses all competitiveness to South African, Zimbabwean or Tanzanian transporters. "For several years, international transport in our province has been the prerogative of foreign companies," deplores its president.
The DRC is the world's largest producer of cobalt and Africa's largest producer of copper.

Algeria partners China for construction of 6,000km railway lines

                                                                                    -  
China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the "best guarantee of development", stressing that "our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km." The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
"China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner," said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
"The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth," he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
"As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities," said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
"This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone," echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

Rwanda is investing heavily in sports through partnerships with clubs such as Arsenal and PSG and the organization of the World Road Cycling Championships in 2025. However this strategy has drawn criticism from the opposition, which doubts it is usefull for the economy of the 73rd FIFA Congress host country.
First, it was a multi-million dollar sponsorship of English Premier League club Arsenal in 2018, followed by a splashy deal to back French giants Paris Saint-Germain a year later. The "Visit Rwanda" can now be seen on Premier League and Ligue 1 pitches.
The vision of Rwandan authorities takes shape with club sponsorships and hosting duties for events ranging from 2021’s Basketball Africa league tournament to cycling’s Road World Championships in 2025.
It has required extensive work to provide the country with new sports infrastructure: $104 million for a 10,000-seat basketball hall, $16 million for a golf course inaugurated in 2021 in Kigali, and $165 million budgeted for the ongoing construction of the National Stadium, which is expected to expand from 25,000 to 45,000 seats by 2024.
President Paul Kagame has spent a small fortune on sports investments that he says will burnish the international image and diversify the economy of the tiny eastern African country.
But the splurge has drawn accusations of “sports-washing”. Campaigners accuse Kagame of crushing political dissent and stifling free speech during his more than 22 years in power.
Improve standard of living"These investments do not meet the immediate needs of the vast majority of Rwandans," said opposition politician Victoire Ingabire, a fierce critic of Kagame.
"I don’t believe there is return for his investments," she told AFP, saying that the sponsorships did little to help rural Rwandans. "It is wasted money."
In the eastern African ccountry, per capita income is estimated at just $822 according to 2021 World Bank figures.
Government officials have defended the projects, arguing that they serve to bolster the country’s reputation as a safe destination for high-profile events.
Pre-pandemic tourism revenues jumped 17 percent to $498 million in 2019, according to Rwanda Development Board.
The board’s CEO, Clare Akamanzi, said at the weekend that the Arsenal and PSG sponsorship deals alone had generated over $160 million in media value. This had in turn brought one million visitors to Rwanda, injecting $445 million in tourism revenues, she added.
"These guests not only left Rwanda with positive memories; they also played a direct role in improving peoples’ lives," she wrote in an opinion piece published Saturday in the East African newspaper.
Fearless"It’s alright to disagree with Rwanda’s governance model, but a campaign to undermine investment in a developing country’s economy, which has a real impact on the lives (of) people, is counterproductive and cynical," she adde.
For Kagame — an ardent Arsenal supporter — the deals had surpassed "by far what we invested", he said this month, adding that the government was on the verge of sponsoring a third team.
And world football’s governing body FIFA will be in town this week for its 73rd congress to reelect its chief Gianni Infantino who is running unopposed.
Authorities say such events bring in much-needed foreign exchange and provide an economic boost to the landlocked nation which is reliant on tourism.
Ruling party MP John-Ruku Rwabyoma echoed her sentiments in an interview with AFP, charging that critics of the deal were "ignorant" and that the government was acting in the best interest of its people.
"We are not here to satisfy critics based on their agenda. Where were all these critics when Rwanda was suffering?"
A foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity told AFP he was skeptical about the claims.
"I don’t know whether it is cost-effective… whether it is paying off in the long run, maybe then, but now, I do not think so," he said, adding that he had not seen the numbers to support the government’s narrative.
Nonetheless, doubts raised by "pundits who mostly know next to nothing about Rwanda, and draw upon tired tropes" will do little to stop the initiatives, according to Clare Akamanzi.
"We will not be bullied into ceding our place at the table," she said.

Corruption inflated costs of high-profile projects in Zambia - IMF

                                                                                    -  
The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday (Jan. 10) that corruption had inflated the cost of numerous high-profile tenders and infrastructure projects in Zambia.
At the request of local authorities, an IMF interdepartmental Governance Diagnostic Assessment mission conducted last year a study focused on governance weaknesses and corruption vulnerabilities.
The assessment revealed serious weakness across all state functions. However, those with particular macroeconomic impact were found in areas including public financial management, granting and managing contracts in the mining sector.
"For instance, enormous financial resources invested in infrastructure projects, such as road construction, provided avenues for corruption, especially in the award of tenders, where political connections allowed members of the elite to bend the rules and access to lucrative contracts", the 96-page report read.
The IMF diagnostic says corruption became particularly institutionalized during 2016-2021 period.
Zambia's current leader vowed, upon his election two years ago, to show "zero tolerance" for graft.
Hakainde Hichilema's first targets were members of the government of his predecessor.
Many arrests however ended in bail, with defendants denying the charges.

Ivory Coast on Monday commissioned the construction of two major infrastructure projects in the Ivorian economic capital Abidjan- that of a metro and the extension of the international airport. The launch of the construction was attended by the French Economy Minister Bruno le Maire who signed agreements  including credit, for this project.
"The purpose of my visit is obviously to mark the concrete launch of the completion of major infrastructure projects here in Abidjan. " Le Maire said in Abidjan.
"The metro is one of the largest infrastructure projects on the continent. It is an ambitious project, a social project that will benefit millions of people in Abidjan" the French minister added.
At the end of 2019, a French consortium comprising the groups Bouygues Travaux Publics, Alstom, Colas Rail and Keolis had been chosen to build the first metro line in Abidjan.
At the time, France committed to cover the contract with a mix of loans from the French Treasury and private financing guaranteed by the French government. The cost of the work is estimated at 1.36 billion euros. The line will cross the Ivorian metropolis from north to south over 37 km, as far as the airport. The construction work has been delayed for years, but the government hopes that the metro will be operational by 2025.

                                                                                    -  
The China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) on Monday handed over Nigeria's first deep sea port to the government after the completion of the huge maritime project in the country's economic hub city of Lagos. 
The completion ceremony of Lekki port which took place at the Lekki Area Site in Lagos State brought together dignitaries and stakeholders from Nigeria and China as well as their international partners. 
In his address, Lagos State Governor Babajide Sanwolu expressed his gratitude to the Chinese government for its support of Nigeria's infrastructure, and praised Chinese enterprises for completing the project construction efficiently and on schedule. 
"The benefit of this project and the benefits to our citizens can be left better imagined, providing jobs for close to 200,000 people with direct and indirect jobs in the next couple of months ahead. 
In addition, we can see the figure adding tens of billions in dollar revenue to our country and to our state and to the host community in taxes and revenue," said Babajide Sanwo-Olu, state governor of Lagos.
 Constructed by the CHEC, the Lekki Deep Sea Port is the largest seaport in Nigeria, and one of the biggest in West Africa. The construction of the port commenced in June 2020, and is designed to handle 1.2 million standard containers annually. 
As a commercial project of tripartite cooperation between China, France and Nigeria, Lekki port is of great significance for promoting Belt and Road cooperation in Africa, said the ambassador. 
"The French side has their experience, shipping routes and cargo volume, then our Chinese side has the construction, use, and maintenance of this port, plus Nigeria is the largest economy in Africa. We are very optimistic," said Wu Di, deputy general manager of China Harbor Engineering Company. 
China's Ambassador to Nigeria Cui Jianchun said Lekki port and the Lekki Free Trade Zone could work together to spur economic development. 
"This is very, very important for Lagos State and also it is very important that I categorize here the deep sea port as a gateway for Nigeria. So Nigeria now through this maritime road can build with the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative. I think that is very, very critical for Nigerian commodities to go to the international market," said Cui. The new port has two container berths, which can berth the world's largest Panamax cargo ship.

Kenyan president William Ruto is seeking an additional $1 billion in loans from China despite Kenya's public debt having reached $70 billion.
President Ruto was was one of a number of global leaders in Beijing to attend the tenth anniversary meeting of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the ambitious plan that aims to connect Africa, Asia and Europe through massive infrastructure and energy projects.
The BRI has seen the development of several infrastructure projects in Kenya, including the Standard Gauge Railway line, which runs from the port city of Mombasa to the Rift Valley via the capital, Nairobi.
Costing $4.7 billion dollars to build, it has faced numerous challenges, including delays and a low uptake of its freight service.
The SGR which started operations in 2017, was initially intended to go all the way to neighbouring Uganda to the west, as well as serving other landlocked countries in eastern and Central Africa.
However, Uganda pulled out and opted instead for partnership with a Turkish firm for the construction of its main line.
The line was mainly constructed using Chinese banks loans and last week.
Kenya currently owes China $6 billion, according to national data. 
Karuti Kanyinga, a research professor at the Institute for Development Studies at the University of Nairobi, said Kenya's "largest creditor today is China."
"We are paying through the nose and most of our earnings are actually going to paying Chinese loans and that is not going to be sustainable," he said.
With many of its Chinese loans set to mature in the current fiscal year, Ruto has taken measures to reduce government spending, including asking all ministries to reduce their budgets by more than 10%.
Critics, however, say he has reneged on his promises by continuing to borrow heavily.

Kenya: Sand harvestings' dire impact on rivers and aquatic life 
                                                      Sand excavators in Kenya
                                                                                    -  
It's hard to believe that a river flowed through this land in Kenya's Machakos County.
It's just over a hundred miles from the capital Nairobi with its demands as a growing city.
Construction, the need to make glass, cement, concrete and a host of everyday items is what leads the workers and their lorries here.
But the constant excavation of sand n is threatening the environment.
These teams of sand excavators say they are aware of the problem, but there is no system to help them manage the harvesting sustainably.
He says he and others have seen the devastation caused by uncontrolled sand harvesting.
"For our sand, sometimes we excavate to the detriment of our grazing areas, leading to our animals lacking water, but if the government can construct sand catchments so that we can have watering and grazing areas, put regulations where we are supposed to pass while carrying sand and restrict others and construct good roads, it will be a good move," says Mutisya.
"The sand carried from these rivers in a day is in hundreds and thousands of tons because an average semi-trailer can carry 50 tons, (but) there are those for 30 tons and one like mine which is 15 tons. So in a day, it's hard to know the exact (amount) but it's thousands of tons," he adds.
Halinish Yusuf is the Sand Conservation and Utilization Director at Makueni County.
She believes there is a clear need to regulate the industry and to carry out studies to discover whether the resources they have in terms of sand can meet the growing demands.
"Because of the strategic importance of sand being the second most extracted natural resource after water and the importance because of the modernization that is going on, demand from the construction industry, demand from the glass industry and many other industries, there is a need to start thinking about regulating it, recycling, regulating where its harvested, how its harvested, but also thinking about alternatives and also thinking about upscaling and monitoring how its harvested, where, the amounts we have so that we start planning for the future," says Yusuf.
In Kiambu County, a new construction site requires more building materials.
The groundbreaking ceremony to mark a new housing project is cause for celebration, but it could have detrimental consequences for the environment from which the sand is being excavated.
Many rivers in this part of Kenya are bare, and only huge protruding rocks remain.
Lorries excavating sand runs on almost a 24-hour cycle to supply building sites like this one in Kiambu.
Site engineer Samuel Waweru of Vimika Construction has to turn this 20-acre site into a block of residential apartments in the next 18 months.
He argues the regulation of sand supply is a government issue, but he says his crews will also be able to use the rocks to make the necessary building materials.
"About the river sand we don't have data on how much sand is being used but it is in huge figures in terms of millions of tons. In the future because of the environment, we have seen some counties prohibit sand harvesting but in case of sand is prohibited, we have an alternative where we can use rock sand. Rock sand we get it from the ballast, when we are crushing the ballast the byproduct is rock sand which is recommended to use as a substitute for river sand," he says.
According to a recent report by the United Nations Environment Programe (UNEP) sand is the second-largest exploited resource after water.
It says globally, 50 billion tons of sand and gravel are harvested every year.
The conservation group WWF says: "sand mining is already putting unprecedented pressure on rivers, floodplains and deltas," leading to erosion, biodiversity loss and reduced protection from storm surges.
Many communities in Kenya depend on this sort of excavation as their only source of income and as a consequence in some regions, uncontrolled harvesting has led to environmental damage which has been largely overlooked.
According to Yusuf, there needs to be an inventory to understand how much sand is left, what damage has been done and what the demands of the industry will be in the coming years.
She says: "Unfortunately, there is no data to show how much sand is going to be demanded in future development, and by the same token there is hardly any research on the amount of sand deposits that we have. And so, there is, even as we make plans, development plans as governments, we are not able to tell how much sand will be required and if we are running into a crisis or not and so, there is a need to invest in research, to know how much sand deposits we have, how much can be harvested, and how much is needed for development."
Mutisya is aware that his livelihood is already going to have an impact on the supply of water to his family because as the sand disappears and the ground heads underground water supplies are depleted.
He says: "We are saying if the government puts in structures, we will be ready to comply with those restrictions because in doing so we will conserve water for our livestock and even for our own consumption, so that there is a restricted area so that we can conserve the water because we are headed to a very dry season where we will be forced to buy water, even for our livestock."

Senegal and the French group Meridiam, which specialises in the financing and development of infrastructure, announced on Monday that they had signed a contract for the acquisition and management of electric buses in Dakar.
the initiative aims at reducing congestion in this West African metropolis.
The BRT (bus rapid transfer) project, on which work is underway, aims to provide Dakar with electric rapid buses from 2023 onwards, running on exclusive lanes between the suburbs and the city centre, over a distance of more than 18 km, a stretch where traffic is slowed down because of traffic jams.
The investment for the electric buses amounts to 127 billion FCFA (193.6 million euros), according to the Senegalese authorities. The total cost of the BRT project is more than 300 billion FCFA (€450 million) financed by donors such as the World Bank.
Senegal signed the contract with Meridiam and a consortium made up of the French state-owned companies SNCF and RATP, the French transport operator Kéolis and Fonsis, a Senegalese investment fund, said on Monday a statement from the Executive Council for Urban Transport in Dakar (Cetud), a body attached to the Senegalese Transport Ministry.
The 15-year concession contract covers "the acquisition, operation and maintenance of rolling stock and BRT systems". Meridiam announced "the provision of a fleet of 100% electric buses, with batteries, including an initial fleet of 121", in a separate press release. This is a concrete project in favour of energy transition that offers a solution adapted to the challenge of climate change, but also an effective alternative to the existing diesel bus network", it said.
The BRT project also includes the construction of workshops and depots, more than 80 km of roads and pavements to be developed or rehabilitated along the axes served, including intersections, bus stops and terminals. It complements the regional express train (TER) running between Dakar and its suburbs, the first section of which was inaugurated in December.
The two transport systems, BRT and TER, which complement each other with feeder lines, aim to relieve congestion in Dakar, where 0.3% of Senegal's 17 million people live and almost all of the country's economic activities are concentrated. Traffic jams officially cost the city 152 million euros per year.

Attack in southern Nigeria: 6 dead and 2 South Koreans kidnapped
                                                      In this frame grab from TV footage shot by the Nigeria television authority on Monday, Oct. 8, 2012,
                                                                                    -  
Four Nigerian soldiers and two civilians were killed and two South Korean employees kidnapped by gunmen who ambushed them in southern Nigeria, the police announced on Wednesday.
The attack took place on Tuesday morning on a road in Rivers State.
Kidnappings for ransom are common in Nigeria, where criminal groups sometimes target foreigners, particularly those working in mines and construction sites far from urban areas.
"The assailants ambushed a convoy of vehicles carrying two Daewoo workers at around 9:30 am. Four soldiers escorting the Koreans and their two civilian drivers were killed in the attack," a senior state police official told AFP.
"The gunmen also kidnapped the two Koreans before fleeing," also taking the soldiers' weapons with them, added the officer, who did not wish to be named.
Rivers State Police spokeswoman Grace Iringe Koko confirmed the attack. "We are investigating the matter and will give details later," she told AFP.
Contacted by AFP, the army and the Deawoo company were not immediately available to comment on the attack.
Several Asian companies, notably Chinese and South Korean, operate in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country, where they are involved in road and rail construction projects.
Foreign workers kidnapped in Nigeria in the past have often been released after paying ransom to their captors.

The people of Kinshasa cannot believe the speed at which a Turkish company has built an imposing financial complex in the heart of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, more accustomed to major Chinese projects than to these new builders of the African continent.
“It’s changed suddenly,” notes a street vendor with a laugh, who has been forced for a little over a year to move his goods as the perimeter of the construction site changes. “They work day and night, even faster than the Chinese,” adds a security agent, somewhat admiringly.
In February 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an official visit to the DRC, his umpteenth trip to Africa. Under his leadership, Ankara has invested a lot in the continent over the past two decades, to develop diplomatic but also economic ties.
Turkish companies have, for example, built a mosque in Ghana, stadiums in Rwanda or Senegal, and airports in several countries.
In Kinshasa, he concluded cooperation agreements concerning in particular security, defense and the construction of infrastructure, including the "Finance Center" whose work was quickly launched, in a concession located near the Turkish school, in the business commune of Gombe.
There was at this place, between the courthouse and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a roundabout pompously called Place de l'Independance, decorated with a sort of faded cement platform carried by stairs leading to no monument.
Visitors sometimes walked there, between the rows of plants in small bags bought by the occupants of the villas with gardens built in the area during the time of the Belgian settlers. Then the palisades and construction bungalows appeared, quickly dominated by half a dozen concrete towers gradually covered with glass panels.
Two of them, around twenty floors high, will house the Ministries of Finance and Budget. The complex, which includes nine buildings in total, will also house a convention center, offices, a large hotel, etc.
The prime contractor is the company Milvest, a subsidiary of the Turkish holding company Miller. According to its CEO Turhan Mildon, who gave a press briefing on the site in mid-September, this project will have employed some 3,000 people - 1,800 Congolese and 1,200 Turks.
The cost of the work is estimated at $290 million, pre-financed by the company, which is also investing $60 million in the hotel which it will manage for 49 years. The finance center is scheduled to be inaugurated on December 2. Before the elections scheduled for the 20th of the same month, in which the current president Félix Tshisekedi is a candidate for a second term.
With its dusty scaffolding, the construction site very close to the new Chinese embassy seems almost to be stalling, and the Chinese workers no longer have the attraction of novelty among the Congolese.
Very present in the country since the time of Mobutu Sese Seko (1965-97), they built the "People's Palace" , the seat of Parliament, and the Martyrs Stadium, an immense enclosure with 80,000 seats.
Under Joseph Kabila (2001-2019), under the terms of a mega-contract "mines for infrastructure", they rebuilt and enlarged large avenues, including the boulevard du 30 Juin, which looks like a highway in the middle of the city. Under Félix Tshisekedi, they continue to build, among other things, a gigantic cultural complex currently nearing completion.
But against them, Turkey is advancing its pawns. In addition to the financial center, the Milvest company is in the running for the renovation and extension of Kinshasa airport, a project initially awarded to a Chinese company but not completed.
The construction of an urban cable car is also planned in an outlying, hilly, and congested area of ​​Kinshasa, for which Milvest is in contract with the French company Poma, a cable transport specialist.
This project, still in its administrative phase, particularly intrigues the inhabitants of Kinshasa, a chaotic city of 15 million souls where electricity and running water are rare commodities in certain neighborhoods.

The construction of an urban cable car is also planned in an outlying, hilly, and congested area of ​​Kinshasa, for which Milvest is in contract with the French company Poma, a cable transport specialist.
This project, still in its administrative phase, particularly intrigues the inhabitants of Kinshasa, a chaotic city of 15 million souls where electricity and running water are rare commodities in certain neighborhoods.

                                                      Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba arrives at celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of UNESCO,  at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, Friday Nov. 12, 2021.
                                                                                    -  
A report titled "105 promises, 13 achievements" takes a closer look at the second 7-year term of Gabonese president Ali Bongo.
Economists Mays Mouissi et Harold Leckat assess in a 196-page-long document the efficiency of the Bongo administration. And the results do not live up to promises.
In a country of less than 2.5 millions inhabitants, with gas, mineral and oil deposits, the unemployment rate rose.  
"Generally speaking, most of the infrastructure projects promised by the President have not been carried out," Mays Mouissi notes.
"I'm speaking about the road projects, the 5 hydroelectric dams, schools, the digital knowledge city he promised, the 700 nurseries and so on..."
"If we want to look at it from a macro-economic perspective, the unemployment rate has risen from 28% to 32%; as for poverty, a third, 35% of Gabonese people live below the poverty line, that is to say on less than two dollars a day, and access to basic social services has totally disintegrated."
The report also notes that 30% of civil servant positions have been allocated to women, bills passed to improve port activity, including the construction of a commercial port and an ore port in Owendo, as well as the preservation of territorial waters. 
But much still needs to be done. Mays Mouissi says the health condition of the president shouldn't be used as an excuse. Ali Bongo suffered a stroke in 2018.
"I think we have to be clear, we mustn't hide behind the President's stroke to justify this failure, because the reality is that, had the President felt unable to govern after his stroke, he would have resigned; if he remained in charge, it was because he felt able to govern," Mouissy considers.
"We've taken into account the fact that there was Covid, and we talk about that in the report. But let us be serious, in many African countries, we can follow the progress of major project, to name only one country, I can mention a well known example, that of Côte d'Ivoire. It shows that we are faced with a problem of governance, leadership, and governmental stability in the management of these projects.
The report's authors hope their initiative will raise public awareness ahead of the August 26 presidential polls. 
President Ali Bongo and his fiercest rival Jean Ping are expected to go again head-to-head.

                                                      Gabon's President Ali Bongo Ondimba arrives at celebrations marking the 75th anniversary of UNESCO,  at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris, Friday Nov. 12, 2021.
                                                                                    -  
A report titled "105 promises, 13 achievements" takes a closer look at the second 7-year term of Gabonese president Ali Bongo.
Economists Mays Mouissi et Harold Leckat assess in a 196-page-long document the efficiency of the Bongo administration. And the results do not live up to promises.
In a country of less than 2.5 millions inhabitants, with gas, mineral and oil deposits, the unemployment rate rose.  
"Generally speaking, most of the infrastructure projects promised by the President have not been carried out," Mays Mouissi notes.
"I'm speaking about the road projects, the 5 hydroelectric dams, schools, the digital knowledge city he promised, the 700 nurseries and so on..."
"If we want to look at it from a macro-economic perspective, the unemployment rate has risen from 28% to 32%; as for poverty, a third, 35% of Gabonese people live below the poverty line, that is to say on less than two dollars a day, and access to basic social services has totally disintegrated."
The report also notes that 30% of civil servant positions have been allocated to women, bills passed to improve port activity, including the construction of a commercial port and an ore port in Owendo, as well as the preservation of territorial waters. 
But much still needs to be done. Mays Mouissi says the health condition of the president shouldn't be used as an excuse. Ali Bongo suffered a stroke in 2018.
"I think we have to be clear, we mustn't hide behind the President's stroke to justify this failure, because the reality is that, had the President felt unable to govern after his stroke, he would have resigned; if he remained in charge, it was because he felt able to govern," Mouissy considers.
"We've taken into account the fact that there was Covid, and we talk about that in the report. But let us be serious, in many African countries, we can follow the progress of major project, to name only one country, I can mention a well known example, that of Côte d'Ivoire. It shows that we are faced with a problem of governance, leadership, and governmental stability in the management of these projects.
The report's authors hope their initiative will raise public awareness ahead of the August 26 presidential polls. 
President Ali Bongo and his fiercest rival Jean Ping are expected to go again head-to-head.

Ivory Coast: The city of Yamoussoukro in its 40th year as capital 
                                                      Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro
                                                                                    -  
From all four corners of the city, it is impossible to miss it: the immense dome of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro is the symbol of the excessiveness of this city, which is nevertheless struggling to establish itself, at the dawn of its 40th year, as the true capital of Côte d'Ivoire.
With its wide avenues, its large wooded areas, its 1970s architecture and its fluid road traffic, Yamoussoukro, in the peaceful center of Côte d'Ivoire, is unlike any other city in the country.
It is the fruit of a dream, that of the first president of independent Côte d'Ivoire, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, to make his native village of N'Gokro the capital of his country. This was done on March 21, 1983.
Over the course of the 20th century, the village became a real city and inherited a name in homage to Yamousso, the Baule queen and great-aunt of "FHB".
"Félix Houphouët-Boigny first wanted to correct the colonial legacy we had received to stop everything being concentrated in one city (Abidjan)," Jean-Noël Loucou, secretary general of the Félix Houphouët Boigny Foundation, a research institute on peace issues, explained to AFP.
"In creating this capital, the idea was to show the African genius with a particular architecture, without big buildings with a lot of green spaces," he adds.
Forty years later, the city is very large and has some 300,000 inhabitants. But still very few institutions.
The heart of Ivorian politics still beats in the coastal south, in Abidjan, with only the Senate and the National Chamber of Traditional Kings and Chiefs having moved away.
However, there has been no lack of political incantations since the death of the founding father in 1993.
Laurent Gbagbo, president from 2000 to 2011, even launched major construction projects to build a National Assembly and a presidential palace. But the two sites are now abandoned, overgrown with vegetation.
"The will to transfer the capital to Yamoussoukro exists. It is the means that are lacking. As a local authority, we do not have the means to go into international debt, so we are obliged to choose profitable financing that will generate money. But I am hopeful that this will happen one day," the region's governor, Augustin Thiam, told AFP.
"Yamoussoukro is not yet in fact the capital of Côte d'Ivoire. But it is out of the question to create a capital from scratch. There are many things to evaluate, quantify, before moving on to the realization," he adds from the gardens of the residence of President Houphouët, his great uncle.
For the time being, Yamoussoukro remains one of the country's main tourist attractions, thanks in particular to its basilica, inspired by that of St. Peter's in Rome and which is the highest Catholic religious building in the world at 158 meters high.
The Caiman Lake, which borders Houphouët's imposing residence, also attracts the curious who observe the dozens of lizards that bask on the banks, right in the center of town.
"Houphouët tried to build Yamoussoukro little by little around three pillars, education with great schools, religion with the basilica, and tourism. The position of the city is strategic, it is a great crossroads in the center of the country. Everyone passes through here," says Nanan Kouassi Konan, chief of the neighboring village of Kami, one of the "cradles" of the former president.
The saturation and tumult of Abidjan with its 6 million inhabitants could also push more and more Ivorians to go back to Yamoussoukro.
Serge Pokou, a hotelier and farmer, took the step a few years ago with his family.
"I naturally opted for the calm of Yamoussoukro, which is a mix of modern city and countryside, steeped in a preserved African culture. The geometry of the main roads, the lush green spaces, the surprising buildings maintain the calm, the charm and the splendor of the city", he appreciates.
It also remains to build a real economic fabric around the capital beyond tourism. The future creation of an industrial zone is hopeful in this respect.
"We expect economic benefits because the capital must live, so we need activities. The major schools in Yamoussoukro are having trouble retaining their engineers and technicians because there is no industry here," says Jean-Noël Loucou.
"But we must be careful to safeguard the identity of the city and its tranquility, which remain, above all, the criterion of choice for those who live there or who seek to settle there," warns Serge Pokou.
                                                                                    01:24

Ivory Coast: The city of Yamoussoukro in its 40th year as capital 
                                                      Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro
                                                                                    -  
From all four corners of the city, it is impossible to miss it: the immense dome of the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace in Yamoussoukro is the symbol of the excessiveness of this city, which is nevertheless struggling to establish itself, at the dawn of its 40th year, as the true capital of Côte d'Ivoire.
With its wide avenues, its large wooded areas, its 1970s architecture and its fluid road traffic, Yamoussoukro, in the peaceful center of Côte d'Ivoire, is unlike any other city in the country.
It is the fruit of a dream, that of the first president of independent Côte d'Ivoire, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, to make his native village of N'Gokro the capital of his country. This was done on March 21, 1983.
Over the course of the 20th century, the village became a real city and inherited a name in homage to Yamousso, the Baule queen and great-aunt of "FHB".
"Félix Houphouët-Boigny first wanted to correct the colonial legacy we had received to stop everything being concentrated in one city (Abidjan)," Jean-Noël Loucou, secretary general of the Félix Houphouët Boigny Foundation, a research institute on peace issues, explained to AFP.
"In creating this capital, the idea was to show the African genius with a particular architecture, without big buildings with a lot of green spaces," he adds.
Forty years later, the city is very large and has some 300,000 inhabitants. But still very few institutions.
The heart of Ivorian politics still beats in the coastal south, in Abidjan, with only the Senate and the National Chamber of Traditional Kings and Chiefs having moved away.
However, there has been no lack of political incantations since the death of the founding father in 1993.
Laurent Gbagbo, president from 2000 to 2011, even launched major construction projects to build a National Assembly and a presidential palace. But the two sites are now abandoned, overgrown with vegetation.
"The will to transfer the capital to Yamoussoukro exists. It is the means that are lacking. As a local authority, we do not have the means to go into international debt, so we are obliged to choose profitable financing that will generate money. But I am hopeful that this will happen one day," the region's governor, Augustin Thiam, told AFP.
"Yamoussoukro is not yet in fact the capital of Côte d'Ivoire. But it is out of the question to create a capital from scratch. There are many things to evaluate, quantify, before moving on to the realization," he adds from the gardens of the residence of President Houphouët, his great uncle.
For the time being, Yamoussoukro remains one of the country's main tourist attractions, thanks in particular to its basilica, inspired by that of St. Peter's in Rome and which is the highest Catholic religious building in the world at 158 meters high.
The Caiman Lake, which borders Houphouët's imposing residence, also attracts the curious who observe the dozens of lizards that bask on the banks, right in the center of town.
"Houphouët tried to build Yamoussoukro little by little around three pillars, education with great schools, religion with the basilica, and tourism. The position of the city is strategic, it is a great crossroads in the center of the country. Everyone passes through here," says Nanan Kouassi Konan, chief of the neighboring village of Kami, one of the "cradles" of the former president.
The saturation and tumult of Abidjan with its 6 million inhabitants could also push more and more Ivorians to go back to Yamoussoukro.
Serge Pokou, a hotelier and farmer, took the step a few years ago with his family.
"I naturally opted for the calm of Yamoussoukro, which is a mix of modern city and countryside, steeped in a preserved African culture. The geometry of the main roads, the lush green spaces, the surprising buildings maintain the calm, the charm and the splendor of the city", he appreciates.
It also remains to build a real economic fabric around the capital beyond tourism. The future creation of an industrial zone is hopeful in this respect.
"We expect economic benefits because the capital must live, so we need activities. The major schools in Yamoussoukro are having trouble retaining their engineers and technicians because there is no industry here," says Jean-Noël Loucou.
"But we must be careful to safeguard the identity of the city and its tranquility, which remain, above all, the criterion of choice for those who live there or who seek to settle there," warns Serge Pokou.
