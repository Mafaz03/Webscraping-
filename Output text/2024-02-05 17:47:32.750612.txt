Africa refines its demands for the climate: financing, debt and taxes
                                                      Kenyan President William Ruto at the closing session of the African Climate Summit at the....
                                                                                    -  
Financing of renewable energies, reform of the international financial system and carbon taxes, the first African summit on the climate drew up this week in Nairobi the list of the demands of Africa to lighten the financial burden of the fight against global warming.
In the "Nairobi Declaration", this continent, which contributes only 2% to 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, tried to find a common position in the global process on climate change, which will culminate with the UN climate conference (COP28) in Dubai at the end of November.
Besides a natural potential to directly generate clean energy (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.), Africa is home to 40% of the world's reserves of cobalt, manganese and platinum, essential for batteries and hydrogen fuel cells.
Paradox: this continent has only attracted 2% of global energy transition investments over the past decade.
The Nairobi Summit called for an investment of $600 billion to increase Africa's renewable energy generation capacity from 56 gigawatts in 2022 to at least 300 gigawatts by 2030.
An imperative for a continent of 1.4 billion inhabitants, 600 million of whom do not have access to electricity.
To help raise the funds needed for these investments, the Nairobi Declaration calls on world leaders to "stand behind the proposal for a carbon tax regime including a tax on fossil fuel trade and shipping and aerial".
These sources of financing, adds the Declaration, could be supplemented by a global tax on financial transactions.
During a summit in Paris in June, French President Emmanuel Macron spoke in favor of a tax on maritime trade while emphasizing the necessary membership of China, the United States and other European countries. for it to become a reality.
In Nairobi, the American envoy on climate John Kerry limited himself to explaining that these different proposals were being studied in Washington.
Participants at the Nairobi Summit added their voices to calls to reform the architecture of the international financial system, which UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described as "outdated, unfair and dysfunctional".
The leaders also called for restructuring and debt relief for their countries. The region's debt burden has soared with the Covid-19 pandemic, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and climate impacts, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.
However, access to IMF and World Bank financing is considered difficult by developing countries, faced with the challenge of lifting a large part of their population out of poverty while freeing themselves from fossil fuels.
The reform of the two institutions should be at the heart of their annual meeting in October in Marrakech.
African countries have pleaded for economic growth less dependent on fossil fuels, beyond the "traditional" model of industrial development.
At the heart of this strategy: to ensure that the raw materials that the continent abounds in, including the minerals used for green technologies, are processed locally and not simply exported.
Another option would be to better monetize the continent's vast ecosystems - forests, mangroves, wetlands - which absorb CO2 on the carbon credit market.
But this market, which is poorly regulated, is the subject of criticism, with certain projects - notably forestry - having, according to their detractors, little impact on the preservation of the environment or the protection of local communities.
“Carbon credits are really a license to pollute,” assures Mohamed Adow, director of the Power Shift Africa think tank.
African states have reminded rich polluting countries to honour their commitment, made in 2009, to provide $100 billion per year in climate financing by 2020.
As well as helping the most vulnerable countries to cope with the immediate impacts of climate change through a fund adopted at COP27 in Egypt, aimed at rich nations to compensate for the “loss and damage” of those in the South.
The heads of state of Nigeria and South Africa, two heavyweights on the continent whose economies rely on fossil fuels, were notably absent from the summit.
However, the African Union assured that the Nairobi Declaration had been adopted unanimously. For Laurence Tubiana, president of the European Climate Foundation, the Nairobi Summit “sends a strong message to the international community”.

                                                      Business Africa presenter Ronald Kato in an interview with Marisa Lourenco, a political and economic risk analyst 
                                                                                    -  
Mining agreements have long been plagued by accusations of unfair terms, where one party - usually investors- wins at the expense of host countries.
Now armed with critical minerals such as cobalt and lithium, African countries are out to rewrite their mining contracts.
Endowed with the world's largest cobalt reserves, the Democratic Republic Congo is renegotiating a $6 billion infrastructure-for-minerals deal signed in 2008 with Chinese miners. Through the state auditor, Kinshasa has demanded that the infrastructure investment increase to $20 billion.
The country had already signaled that it was no longer business as usual for miners when it introduced a new mining code in 2018 that rattled Swiss giant Glencore.
In Botswana, President Mokgwetsi Masisi has threatened to sever ties with diamond miner De Beers over profit sharing.
Under the current agreement, the government sells 25% of diamonds mined by Debswana - their joint venture - with the remaining 75% sold by De Beers.
Other mining economies such as South Africa, Zambia, Guinea and Angola have reviewed or looking to renegotiate the terms of their mining agreements with investors.
While the World Bank and IMF advocated liberal mining codes favorable to investors in the 1990s, African countries are now pushing back, demanding more from their resources.
Marisa Lourenco is a political and economic risk analyst with a focus on mining, technology and energy. She joins the show with insights on whether an African-led mining order is possible.
With Nigeria’s economy battling headwinds, the creative sector has emerged as a beacon of hope. It is projected to add nearly 3 million jobs by 2025, and to top $100 million by 20230.
However, a lack of access to cheap credit is holding back entrepreneurs.
After crossing the $1 trillion mark in 2021, mobile money transaction values set a new record in 2022, growing by 22% year on year to approximately $1.26 trillion.
836 billion of that was processed in Africa, where users also jumped to 781 million.
A new state of industry report by GSMA argues that mobile payments not only help people with their day-to-day needs, but also have a lasting socio-economic impact.
For example, partnerships between mobile money providers and pay-as-you-go solar dealers have made asset financing for solar home systems, smartphones and clean cooking stoves possible for previously unbanked, low-income consumers.

In a lecture room at the Electrical Engineering Department of the Papua New Guinea University of Technology in Lae, Morobe Province, participants of a three-week long ‘Renewable Energy’ Training stood in awe as the lecturer demonstrated how a smart electricity grid works.As the students gathered around the device, the lecturer explained how the grid could simultaneously utilise wind, hydro and solar power to produce clean energy.When one energy source turned off, the others would continue to produce power and ensure continued electricity supply.The lecturer asserted that such grids were key to expanding electricity access in Papua New Guinea, where only 20 per cent of the population currently enjoys regular access to electricity.The training was held under the renewable energy component of the European Union-funded “Support to Rural Entrepreneurship, Investment and Trade” (STREIT) programme, which aims to expand electricity access in the rural areas of East and West Sepik Provinces through renewable energy solutions.As one of the implementing agencies of the programme, UNDP has installed solar photovoltaic systems to schools and health facilities in six sites in the targeted provinces.Over 30 seasoned electricians, engineers, PNG Power employees, and teachers from East and West Sepik Provinces attended the training in Lae to gain the necessary skills to maintain these systems and to become solar energy experts in their respective communities.This marked the third and final training for the participants since 2021. Mr. Wilson Lalu, an electrician with over 40 years of experience, says that the training gave him a new perspective on renewable energy.Mr. Wilson currently works on one of project sites of the STREIT Programme in Nagam, East Sepik Province.Under UNDP’s leadership, the project has installed 176 solar panels and connected them to a battery system that provides continuous power to all dormitories, classrooms and staff houses in a local school.“My involvement at Nagam was during the commissioning of the system. Being an electrician, I had never worked on solar systems like that before. The training has given me a new perspective on the industry,” Mr Lalu said.Computer science teacher and licenced electrician from Vanimo Secondary School Bobby Tagen, also participated in the training. In 2023, UNDP installed a solar photovoltaic system on the school grounds and connected it to the main grid operated by PNG Power.The initiative ensured reliable electricity access to the school’s over 800 students.“The system has been working perfectly since it was installed in 2023. This training taught me about how such systems can be kept running for a longer period of time. This knowledge will help me maintain the system in our school and has motivated me to continue promoting the use of solar power in my community,” Mr. Tagen said.The training was facilitated by the University of Technology’s Sustainable Energy Research Institute (SERI).The Director of SERI, Professor Dapsy Olatona, hopes the training will yield positive results for the communities of the participants.“Our aim is that the participants will return to their villages and take part in installing renewable energy systems, particularly solar systems, in a manner that SERI has taught them.”The Government of Papua New Guinea has set a target of connecting 70 per cent of Papua New Guinea’s population to renewable electricity by 2030. By 2050, the Government hopes to have reached universal electricity access throughout the country.UNDP hopes to contribute to this aim through its various initiatives in the country.In addition to its activities under the STREIT programme, UNDP is currently constructing a one-megawatt solar farm in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.The construction is funded by the Government of Japan and the engineers working on the project will undergo the same training at the PNG University of Technology in Lae.“UNDP is committed to supporting the Government in increasing access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy throughout Papua New Guinea.Without enhancing access to clean energy, we cannot succeed in our efforts to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and enhance environmental sustainability in Papua New Guinea,” stated UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Nicholas Booth, after the training.“The sustainable future of our planet depends on countries making a successful transition onto greener and cleaner forms of energy.The European Union is proud to finance and support this initiative that will enable Papua New Guinea to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and expand electricity access to some of the most vulnerable communities in the country,” added the European Union Ambassador to Papua New Guinea, H.E. Jacques Fradin.

Temperature to increase as solar flares and El Nino pair up - Post Courier

Chief Meteorologist Jimmy Gomoga yesterday warned the government of cosmic weather patterns which have the potential to cause mayhem in PNG this year.
These are solar flares caused by implosions on the sun’s surface which create heat waves that have been experienced lately around the globe, and which are known to also affect radio transmissions and communications.
Coupled with the severe dry season currently experienced in most parts of PNG, it has the potential to leave many people without food and water in the coming months.The country is currently in its annual wet season period and may experience some rainfall however, according to data collected over the last three months, the rainfall has dropped significantly from an average of 300 milliliters to only 50 milliliters.The heatwaves experienced in Port Moresby and some parts of PNG has caused a sharp increase in temperature which is expected to reach an average high of 37 degrees celsius daily in the coming weeks.“We have seen an increase in solar activity. According to the predictions, it will increase in 2024 and will peak in 2025. It takes about a year before we see the impacts coming on board.“The immediate impact, however, is the increase in temperatures especially the atmosphere and humidity. It becomes very unpleasant and that is what we have been experiencing. Now that El Nino is actually is going to peak and with this solar activity that is going to really amplify the impacts for PNG.” With both the solar flare and El Nino expected to peak in 2025, Mr Gomoga urged the government to start preparing now.“With both phenomena, the impact will be severe. It may not show right now but when it peaks in 2025 it will be big. The government must start preparing now. Tube crops in the highlands will be affected, water sources will dry up affecting electricity generation. Water and food will become scarce. The impact will be bigger than the 1997 drought because the population then was only seven million now it is climbing up to 11 million people,” he said.According to historical data, the highest temperature recorded was 47 Degrees Celsius in Kavieng, New Ireland province which is expected to be beaten. “The temperature across the country has increased generally. For Port Moresby the highest temperature is now 35 degrees but we might go beyond that come January and February. By March we could have things heating up with temperatures going higher as the sun rotates. We are looking at 37 degrees on average and that is hot,” he added.Meanwhile, the El Nino has affected 90 percent of the country over the last three months. Parts of coastal Sandaun, Morobe, East New Britain and West New Britain have experienced severe dry period and this will spread to the rest of PNG until the El Nino peaks in 2025.“The El Nino has different impacts across the country. We will not see this as yet because we are in our wet season. But our rainfall has reduced. The rainfall that will occur during this wet season will not be enough to cater for that. Once we step into our dry season in April and May this year we will see the impacts,” he added.

The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO), under the EU-STREIT PNG Program, has introduced a game-changing and climate-friendly technology, Vanilla Solar Dryers.
This initiative is set to revolutionise the vanilla production process, benefiting over 1,000 rural households across 40 farmer groups in the Sepik region of the country.
These solar dryers, numbering 199 at this stage and distributed across 9 central locations in the Sepik, harness the power of the sun to expedite and enhance the drying process of vanilla beans.
This solar technology is not only eco-friendly but also ensures uniformity in bean quality –– a critical factor for premium-grade vanilla, highly sought after in international markets.
The FAO will continue to support with solar dryers to remaining vanilla producers in the near future.
The solar dryers significantly reduce the curing time while maintaining the size, aroma, and uniform colour of the beans.
Each solar dryer has an impressive capacity, drying 10 kg of vanilla beans every seven days.
Constructed with durability in mind, these dryers have a functional lifespan of up to 5 years, signifying a long-term investment in sustainable vanilla production. A key feature of these solar dryers is their eco-friendly design, thus reducing the carbon footprint associated with vanilla bean processing.
This aligns with global efforts to promote environmentally sustainable agricultural practices.
The prototype of these solar dryers was developed through a collaboration with the Yawasoro TVET Centre in East Sepik Province and a private metal workshop in Wewak, involving local students and technicians.

A solar mini grid will soon be lighting up classrooms, dormitories, and teachers’ housing in Pimaga.Access to the electricity provided through this mini grid will transform the educational experience of young people and teachers at the Pimaga Vocational Education and Training (VET) centre.“For the first time we will have access to power, to support our learning needs, provide a better environment for those students and teachers that live on campus and create a safer environment for everyone, particularly women and girls,” said Warubi Masahimu, manager of the Pimaga VET.The Santos Foundation and SLB (Schlumberger) have entered an exciting new partnership to support the Pimaga VET with a solar mini grid to power the centre.This K1.8 million investment is part of the Santos Foundation’s Youth Opportunities Program focussed on delivering greater outcomes for young people in Kutubu.“Education, training and employment opportunities are core to this program, and we are excited about our partnership with both SLB and the VET centre,” said Senior Projects manager, Anthony Uechtritz.The new investment will mean the students will now have the opportunity to use modern equipment as part of their trade training “to gain hands- on experience and training they would not be able to get otherwise. It means they will be job ready in a competitive market,” added Matt Loth of SLB.Energy poverty is a critical development issue and finding a renewable energy solution for a remote setting is life changing. It will mean better opportunities previously impossible in this community.The Asian Development Bank Energy Sector summary states that PNG has one of the lowest electrification rates in the Pacific, with only 13 per cent of the population having access to electricity.The Santos Foundation is proud to be partnering with SLB and the Pimaga VET centre on this project and believes the contribution will make a lasting impact on the local community that access the VET centre and look forward to seeing the benefits of this project in the years to come.

BY FRANCO NEBASThe Morobe Provincial Government has signed an agreement with a Dubai-based company to build a solar power in the province.Morobe Governor Luther Wenge announced this when signing a memorandum of agreement with Dubai-based AstralENERGY.
Mr Wenge said power outages was a legacy issue to the people of Lae and Morobe for years.He said the issue was never being addressed by the past successive governments up until today.“Morobe is now looking towards Dubai to supply and installed two solar power plants possibly in Lae and Huon Gulf districts,” he said.
He said AstralENERGY has been engaged under the private investment programs arranged by the Morobe Provincial Government.To facilitate the finance and construction of the Energy Impact Projects or programs, such as with solar, hydro and geothermal power plants, are one of the key policies for this government,” he said.The solar power plants will be built and installed at two different locations.
“One will be located at Labu supplying power to the main industrial centres including the wharf and market areas while the other one to be built behind Martin Luther Seminary supplying Malahang Industrial centre and surrounding areas,”he said.The total capacity which to be generated shall be of 100 megawatt that capable to supply power to the city.Mr Wenge said the total cost of the project is K250 million and will be 50 per cent counter-funding between the AstralENERGY and Government of PNG through the Private Investment Program. The project will generate huge income for the province as the power will be sold at half price charged by PNG Power Limited.The company engaged by MPG as a partner in this economical viable project is AstralENERGY Project Management Services in PNG.It is a Dubai-based company but since having joint venture partners with provinces and government of PNG in such magnitude projects in its specialities, the company has then incorporated under the Investment Promotion Authority and in the process of establishing.AstralENERGY chief executive officer Richard Peter said the project is expected to commence before the end of June 2023.

The US government, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and Santos bring electricity to a rural community in Southern Highlands Province.In partnership with the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority, Santos through the Santos funded Oil Search Foundation (OSF) and USAID launched the Pimaga Rural Hospital Solar Electrification Project on March 28, at Pimaga, in Nipa Kutubu district, Southern Highlands Province.The mini grid installed through the project will now serve not only hundreds of patients seen at the clinic but will also provide power to the dozen or more clinic staff and their families who live on the compound.
Enhanced electrical capacity at the clinic will keep patients more comfortable, as well as allowing clinicians to carry out medical treatments more reliably and safely.Santos country chair PNG, Leon Buskens said the use of renewable energy such as solar demonstrates Santos’ Vision 2040 to be a leading global provider of clean fuels and investing in carbon reduction initiatives.“This collaboration with USAID and the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority (SHPHA) to bring electricity through the solar mini grid project will go a long way in providing a much-needed source of cheap, economically viable, and sustainable form of energy source,” Mr Buskens said.
Santos Foundation’s chief programs officer, Jean Martin said the Foundation is committed to working with their partners like SHPHA and the district development authority to strengthen the systems that enhance service delivery.“Reliable clean energy will improve service delivery at Pimaga Rural Hospital, and we are pleased to have been able to partner with USAID PEP to undertake this piece of work,” she said.The mini-grid project was supported through USAID’s Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership (USAID-PEP) Activity, a five-year project in partnership with the Government of PNG that will contribute to the goal of connecting 70 per cent of PNG’s population to electricity by 2030.

TOKYO: Japan’s Moon lander has resumed operations after being shut for a week due to a power supply issue.The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency said it re-established contact with the lander Sunday night, indicating that the glitch had been fixed.Its solar cells are working again after a shift in lighting conditions allowed it to catch sunlight, the agency said.It could not generate power when it landed on 20 January as the solar cells pointed away from the sun.With the Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (Slim) spacecraft, Japan became only the fifth country to achieve a soft touchdown on the moon after the US, the former Soviet Union, China and India.The spacecraft ran on battery power for several hours before authorities decided to turn it off to allow for a possible recovery of electricity when the angle of sunlight changed.In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Jaxa shared a photograph taken by Slim of a nearby rock that it said resembled a toy poodle.The lander will analyse the composition of rocks in its search for clues about the origin of the moon, Jaxa said.Slim landed at the edge of an equatorial crater known as Shioli, within 55 m (180 ft) of its target in a crater. Jaxa described it as an “unprecedented pinpoint landing”.

NiuPower Ltd has donated 118 solar kits to the Gorohu village in the Central Province.
NiuPower chief executive officer Michael Uiari said access to electricity is one of the country’s biggest priorities with the government’s aim to cover 75 per cent of the country’s rural population by 2030.
“On behalf of NiuPower and its shareholders, Kumul Petroleum and Santos, we are pleased to extend the support to Gorohu and its surrounding communities. 
We have donated 118 solar kits so that they have lights,” Mr Uiari said.
“These communities are important to us. We have the PNGLNG and we have been operating since 2019, and as part of our program we have extended some of what we do to the community here.
“They are isolated and that’s what touched me, so we were able to provide solar kits so they can have light.”
Mr Uiari said the rest is up to the other businesses like the Telco’s who can set up towers: “They already have 118 households who will be connected as customers.
“When you have electricity it opens the pathway to other services, which is an example of what can be done on the back of electricity.”
Mr Uiari highlighted that NiuPower has so far, through its various community programs, invested around K4.5 million.
“Since 2019 we have invested about K4.5 million across our project area footprint covering five areas.”
