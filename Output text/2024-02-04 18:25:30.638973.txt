The Hela Wigmen will relocate to Tari by 2025 but they will host some home games in the 2024 Digicel Cup competition as their home ground stadium would be completed by mid this year, Hela Governor Philip Undialu said.The K10 million stadium was halted by 14 months due to a legal proceeding taken against the provincial government by an Incorporated Land Group who claimed ownership of the land, although the land was outrightly purchased from the landowner.However, he said the court has directed for meditation and they would start the process by February this year, and that will not affect the construction of the stadium.“This stadium is made of steel, no scaffolding is used, only metal is used to construct the stadium seats and the foundation. It is co-funded by Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (K5m) and the Hela Provincial Government (K5m).Mr Undialu said since 2013, the Hela Wigmen has been operating in Lae and Port Moresby because they do not have a home stadium, despite winning some premiership titles.“Therefore, we have constructed our own stadium and we have to complete it before June this year and hopefully host several Wigmen home games by June,” he said.Mr Undialu said the first stage of the stadium with a capacity of 7000 seats is now under construction and the contractor, China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CECC) is working on the grandstand and is putting up the roof.“I’m happy the Stadium is taking shape. The roofing and the final touches are being done on the first stage of the stadium. The first stage will have a smaller capacity of about 7000 but that will increase in the second stage development of the stadium, which will have a total capacity of 10,000 seats. The second phase will be bigger and will have a top floor for VIPS and the media, and it will also consist of a cafeteria. The main grandstand will have a double floor,” he said.Also included in the second phase of the development will be a 50-men Wigmen Hotel, a hotel dedicated to the Wigmen, and will be managed by a management team to generate revenue for the club.The hotel will also have a swimming pool, gym and other facilities with rooms for the players while other rooms will be up for guests.The stadium will also have several kiosks to lease out, a source of revenue for the club.He said the club must raise its own funds to sustain its operation in the years to come and the Wigmen Hotel, the kiosk and the gate takings are some revenue streams for the Wigmen club they are looking at, as their current sponsor will not always be around to support the team.Governor Undialu said the Hela Provincial Government will also partner the three districts of Koroba Kopiago-Komo-Hulia and Magarima to build mini stadiums in the three districts.He said the stadium will also be used for other activities such as big church gatherings, cultural events and sporting events.

The Kokopo Central Business District’s Williams Road is gradually becoming more and more dotted with potholes.
On a busy day, the traffic stalls. Vehicles that attempt to avoid these potholes pose risks to pedestrians as they cross the main road to shops or the main market.
The main crossing from the Kokopo market to K Central supermarket is always busy and potholes have also riddled this main crossing.

The development forum and development and construction of the P’ynang gas project in the Western Province will come after the completion of the construction phase of the Papua LNG project.
Minister for Petroleum Kerenga Kua said while responding to questions without notice from Western Governor Taboi Awi Yoto who wanted to know when the development forum for the landowners, the provincial government, the affected LLG and the State will be conducted.
The Governor also wanted to know when the State would pass the P’ynang Gas Fiscal Stability Act to give the provincial government and the affected district development authority (DDA) access to the tune of K150 million as tax credit fund as captured in the gas agreement.
Mr Kua in his response said there are two similar projects within the same region, the Elk Antelope in Gulf and the Pynang in the Western Province, and they share the same geographical region.
Therefore, the government has sequenced the two projects, by firstly starting off with the development and the construction of the Papuan LNG project hopefully by 2024 and then move over to Pýnang, running back to back within the space of 4 years.
This means that the Development Forum for Pynanag will take place in 2027 and the construction and the development would start in 2028.
Mr Kua said this sequencing is basically to run parallel simultaneously, and that is due to the fact that the country is small with a small public service, and they cannot be engaged in two similar projects at once, as technically skilled fields like these requires a lot of work.
He said the State need not only the public servants but the skilled private sector contractors in such big projects and with a small workforce, they cannot be engaged in two major highly skilled projects concurrently.
The Minister said the other reason is for the greater benefit of the country’s economy, and that is to expand the economic benefits so the economy is sustained for a longer period and not to run concurrently and collapse the economy.

The Edevu hydro power station construction is on schedule, with all work to be completed by the end of September, 2023.
The Edevu power project, opened in April this year, will supply 54 megawatts into the Port Moresby grid with 2x turbines each producing 27 megawatts.
The current peak loan demand in Port Moresby grid is 132 megawatts.
PNG Power chairman McRonald Nale said Edevu’s bigger sized generating units with higher inertia will add stability to the Port Moresby grid.
“With Edevu, Port Moresby grid will have an improved ability to withstand electrical shocks and disturbances, thereby reducing network blackouts. 
Having high inertia machines from Edevu will significantly reduce total system outages caused by network cascading effects. 
Edevu hydro power brings clean, fuel free and low-cost power to supply increasing demand in the Port Moresby grid,” Mr Nale said.
PPL estimates about 40 to 50 megawatts are produced and utilised by large industries off grid due to reliability issues.
“With low cost power from Edevu hydro, this will improve network regulation and improved attention to our customers through a range of initiatives, including Amnesty Program and Feeder Team Management, we believe the industries not on the PPL grid will reconnect,” Mr Nale said.
PNG Hydro Development Ltd managing director Allan Guo said the total towers of the main transmission lines to be built from Edevu to the Moitaka is 104.
“Work on erecting and stringing of towers is completed from tower 1- tower 39. From tower 39 — 89, erection of towers completed without stringing. 
This week, our contractors will be working on towers 90 — 95, that is doing the foundation work and so forth,” Mr Guo said.
By the end of September, PNG Power will officially do the technical commissioning for the Edevu Hydro Power Station, and will run on full operation for three days, before final tests are done and the official commissioning takes place.

Growth in Mobile and Telecommunication companies like Digicel Pacific and Vodafone PNG is raising concerns for regulations on location for building mobile communication towers across the country.
Digicel Pacific and Vodafone PNG recently announced their intention to increase their reach, 
spiking the need for building more telecommunication towers and to ensure that it does not interfere or pose any harm to the people, space and infrastructure.
The Post-Courier understands that there has been very little update from the National Information and Communication Technology Authority on the process for developing these regulatory guidelines to guide the construction of mobile communication towers.
NICTA released a public notice on April 29, 2022, stating that it was in consultation with the industry to develop guidelines for the construction of towers.
In the notice, NICTA issued few orders which are to be observed by the mobile network operators, tower owners and general public.
The orders issued also prohibits the construction of mobile towers within 200 metres of existing towers, schools or hospitals and in residential areas, industrial areas or near highways and main roads.
In December 2022, NICTA chief executive officer Kila Gulo-Vui, said the consultation process of developing the guidelines was under way and NICTA was engaging with the industry and city authority to develop these guidelines.
He said the industry is aware of the regulator’s expectations and they are providing their responses.
“We will go through the process and when the consultation is completed and everything is finalised, NICTA will make the announcement for the industry to be aware of,” Mr Gulo-Vui said.
He said they are currently in dialogue with concerned stakeholders on the existing towers built in public areas and which should be at least 200 metres to the existing infrastructure such as schools or hospitals and in residential, industrial areas or near highways and main roads.

MORE and more women are joining building and construction trades, an industry traditionally dominated by men.LizApril Fisa and Sharon Katari are part of this new generation of women in the building and construction industry. Their stories will serve as an inspiration to other women and girls who wish to enter similar skilled technical trades in their career.Employed by Digara Construction Ltd, LizApril and Sharon are proud to be part of the company’s current project- the construction of a new 40-bed female dormitory at the University of Papua New Guinea’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences, funded by a Papua New Guinea-Australia Partnership Incentive Fund grant of K8.1 million.
Companies like Digara have seen the benefits of employing women and are keen to support and en[1]courage their female workers and provide an avenue for Papua New Guinean women to apply their trade skills.Given the project is targeted at improving access to quality education and increasing employment opportunities for women, the focus on having women construction workers participating in the building sector is welcomed.For Ms Fisa, from Tufi in the Northern Province, joining Digara was an opportunity she couldn’t pass up on. She is determined to make her mark in the industry.
“It’s kind of tough. When I first came (to this project), there weren’t any females,” Ms Fisa said.“I was like, man, how am I going to survive here? But then again, I’m the only girl in a family full of boys so, I was like, just treat them well, just like how I treat my brothers at home.“Talk to them properly and make them feel comfortable because most of these guys have never worked with a female co-worker before so it’s quite hard to communicate and talk to them.” Her collaborative approach has paid off.
“I usually initiate discussions and always put myself out there and say hey, I’m here – you need anything, you need help or whatever let me know,” Ms Fisa said.“That’s my approach.” And after being on the job as an electrical assistant for just three months, she is already noticing a shift in behaviour by her male colleagues.“They are comfortable with me being around. At first, they were like, we have a female, and we are very careful with how we speak,” she said.“Because there were no females around in the first place, they expressed themselves freely.It’s different now, they are very mindful and respectful towards us.”In fact, Ms Fisa has been inspired by her experiences on the project that she hopes to continue in the construction industry and become a licensed electrician in the future. Ms Katari from Lufa in the Eastern Highlands Province has been in the trade for a lot longer than Ms Fisa, starting with Digara four years ago as a welder.But she agrees that women face particular challenges in the industry, especially juggling working and being a mother to a two-year-old son.“I’m proud to be in this field – I wouldn’t let the opportunity go by like that. I can’t let motherhood hinder my professional career,” Ms Katari said.“There is always a balance in what I do and I’m enjoying it right now.The most important achievement for me is doing a good job and being recognised by the company I work for.”At Digara, she is responsible for assembling pieces of metal together, repairing damage in metal components as well as reviewing blueprints, cutting metal, and smoothing molten metal to remove creases.

“These institutions are agency run institutions which have been serving the province and country for years” he said.Mr Yengaha said there has been no proper development done on the road for almost a decade.He said it is not safe for them to walk from the college down to the Kalabond field because of the ongoing holdups.

UPNG journalism studentThousands of people living in the Gerehu suburb in Port Moresby will for the next 12 months experience difficulties in commuting following the start of a year long road construction.After the completion of the first construction of the main area road from Gerehu stage one to stage six, another year construction work is underway in the corridors of Gerehu, along the bus stop next to the Bismillah shops.
According to Phoenix Construction who has undertaken the project, the half a mile road structure starting from the Gerehu main bus stop roundabout to the Kasia Cycle roundabout is anticipated to cause traffic congestion that will definitely impact daily commuters.Phoenix site engineer, Philimon Mondolame said the new road construction progress will depend on the funding from the National Capital District Commission.“The reason for working at one section of the road at a time is because the funding is not paid in full but in installments so the funds are released when a block of the road is completed,” he said.
Another factor that significantly affect construction is weather as periods of heavy rain hinder any progress.Mr Mondale noted that traffic is currently being controlled by blocking the road in front of Gerehu Mart in order to work on the left side of the bus stop.Once the bus stop is completed then the blockade will be shifted and normalcy should return.

It was a first of its kind in the history of the Telefomin people to access a new road.This new road from Tabubil, Western province connecting the first village, Urapmin in Telefomin district of West Sepik province was launched last Friday.The Urapmin villagers including nearby villages in the district and North Fly people, Tabubil and Kiunga turned out in numbers to witness the launching ceremony.Urapmin ward president Siniki Babeloki said it is a new beginning for them.“We have over 700 people in this village and we are so happy.“We walk for three days and nights to reach Tabubil.“We carry store goods, iron sheets, teaching materials and other things from Tabubil and walk back through the cold, foggy and rugged mountainous terrain to reach Telefomin.“Some of our people have died along this bush tracks.” he said.Mr Babeloki said seeing the machinery and trucks in the village is a joyous experience as the construction of the road means they can now reach Tabubil by truck and return home the same day.Telefomin district administrator Joshua Himina said the lack of road has been a major hindrance for delivery of services.However, this road will enable them to see more changes in the district.“New roads linking nearby villages will be done, health centres, schools and other services as well. All of these services are captured in our five -year development plan,” he said.It took six years since 2018 to construct road connecting Western and West Sepik provinces.Other eight kilometres of road construction from Urapmin village to Telefomin station will continue this month and further road construction will continue to Oksapmin rural LLG starting this year.The engineers from the contractor Ipwenz Construction Limited (IPZ), other sub- contractors with support from Ok Tedi Mine through the tax credit scheme under the Connect PNG program have helped established the road.Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, Minister for Works and Highways and Telefomin MP Solan Mirisim, Labour Minister and Rai Coast MP Kessy Sawang, Hela Governor Philip Undialu, OTML managing director Kedi Ilimbit and other dignitaries witnessed the event last Friday.

                                                                                    -  
Chinese president Xi Jinping opened the Belt and Road forum in Beijing on Wednesday, with a message that China "can only do well when the world is doing well".
China is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which has extended Chinese economic and geopolitical influence across the globe. 
In his opening speech, Xi promised to extend access to China's market for international firms and for new financing exceeding $100 billion for other developing economies.
He added that two Chinese-backed development banks – the China Development Bank and the Export–Import Bank of China – will each set 350 billion yuan ($47.9 billion) financing windows, while an additional 80 billion yuan ($11 billion) will be injected into the Silk Road Fund to support BRI projects.
"Viewing other’s development as a threat, or taking economic interdependence as a risk will not make one’s own life better or speed up one’s own development," Xi said.
"We have learned that the silk road spirit of peace and cooperation, mutual learning and mutual benefit, openness and win-win is the most important source of strength for the Belt and Road cooperation."
The initiative has deepened China's relations with Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East through large infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, railroads and ports. 
As for China-Africa cooperation, one of the BRI's most significant features is its emphasis on green infrastructure projects and renewable energy development.
Of the representatives from more than 130 mostly developing countries attending the forum, including at least 20 heads of state and government, several African leaders are present. 
Kenyan's President William Ruto and Ethiopia's President Abiy Ahmed, amongst others, are in attendance.

In Beijing this week, the tenth-year milestone of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be marked at a forum that highlights this often-debated model for economic development.
Large signs reading "The Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation" are displayed next to a bustling Beijing road. The previous forums convened in 2017 and 2019.  
This program, championed by China's President Xi Jinping, has provided funding for numerous global infrastructure projects, including ports, power plants, and railways. Nevertheless, the initiative has received criticism for its approach to providing loans to developing nations, which often results in them incurring substantial debt.
Wang Yiwei, the Director of the Institute of International Affairs at China's Renmin University, asserts that BRI encourages a collaborative approach to development with partner nations, providing them with paths to modernization.
Recent events, such as the construction of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in Indonesia, which commenced earlier this month, underscore the mixed reception BRI has encountered. While this 142-kilometer railway significantly reduces travel time between Jakarta and Bandung, it was marred by delays and escalating costs. Originally expected to launch in 2019, disputes over land acquisition, environmental concerns, and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the project. Furthermore, the estimated cost of 66.7 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion USD) ballooned to 113 trillion rupiah ($7.3 billion USD).
Similarly, the $5.9 billion Chinese-built railway linking Laos' capital, Vientiane, to the southern Chinese city of Kunming began operations in 2021, with over 60% of the investment being borrowed – an unusually high percentage for an infrastructure project, according to foreign experts. This has led to the initiative being perceived by some as a "debt trap."
Chinese contractors are also constructing a high-speed rail line from Bangkok to the Laos border, expected to be operational by 2028.
An example of a debt issue emerged earlier this year when a power plant in Jordan, once touted as a groundbreaking project to provide the country with a significant energy source, turned sour. Jordan now finds itself in an international legal battle and billions of dollars in debt to China for a plant that is no longer necessary for its energy needs, due to subsequent agreements made since the project's inception.
A "risk prevention" approach will be critical for the future of the Belt and Road Initiative, given the growing complications in a world marked by ongoing conflicts.
The Belt and Road Initiative Forum is scheduled to commence on October 18.

Kenyan President William Ruto arrives in China for Belt and Road Forum
                                                      Kenya's President William Ruto poses during a photo session at the Palais Brongniart for the New Global Financial Pact Summit in Paris on June 22, 2023.
                                                                                    -  
Kenyan President William Ruto has arrived in Beijing to participate in the third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, scheduled for two days in the Chinese capital.
This forum holds great diplomatic significance for China, as it's the most important event of the year and a notable celebration of the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative.
Over 140 countries and 30 international organizations, including leaders, officials, and representatives from various sectors, have confirmed their participation.
The Belt and Road Initiative, initiated by China in 2013, aims to create trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia, Europe, Africa, and beyond along the historic Silk Road trade routes.
In the past decade, over 150 countries and 30 international organizations have engaged with the BRI framework, marking a significant milestone in global cooperation.
William Ruto intends to ask China for a $1 billion loan and a debt repayment restructuring plan, the country's vice-president said on Friday.
According to Rigathi Gachagua, the head of state, who criticized his predecessor's heavy borrowing from Beijing, will visit China at an unspecified date. He will ask for "more time to slowly repay the debt", as well as a billion dollars to complete road projects delayed by lack of funding.
Kenya, one of East Africa's largest economies, has accumulated more than $68 billion in debt, equivalent to 67% of its gross domestic product.
"We are a responsible government, we can't say we won't pay the debt," Rigathi Gachagua told a local radio station.
China, which William Ruto has not visited since his election in August 2022, is the country's second-largest creditor, after the World Bank.
In Mombasa, East Africa's largest port on the Kenyan coast, it is financing the construction of a new terminal.
Beijing has also lent $5 billion (€4.7 billion) for the realization of the most expensive infrastructure project since the country's independence in 1963: the train line that since 2017 has linked the port city of Mombasa to Naivasha, in the Rift Valley, via the capital Nairobi.
During the election campaign, William Ruto had denounced the loans of his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta, pledging to find other ways of stimulating development to build the country's necessary infrastructure.
China has rejected criticism that its lavish loans are plunging some countries, particularly in Africa, into debt overload.
During a visit to Kenya in July, Beijing's head of diplomacy, Wang Yi, praised bilateral cooperation and a "win-win" partnership.
Despite a dynamic economy, around a third of Kenya's population lives in poverty.
Economic growth slowed to 4.8% last year, from 7.6% in 2021, hit by the global fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a devastating regional drought that hit the country's vital agricultural sector.
Inflation remained high, at an annual rate of 6.8% last month.
In July, global ratings' agency Fitch Ratings downgraded Kenya's ability to repay international lenders from "stable to negative", citing tax hikes and social unrest.

Street tennis is a new sport recently introduced to Rwandans following the bilateral partnership established between Rwanda and Barbados, a country in the West Indies.
The Rwandan government has always encouraged sports and physical practice and it plans to expand street tennis to different parts of the country.
Often played in recreation areas and residential areas, this sport can also be used to develop tennis skills, organize regional tournaments or attract tourists.
_" This game has the advantage of attracting many people, both Rwandans and foreigners, it can also create opportunities for tourism. The country has many roads in the city of Kigali and around the capital. It's a game that doesn't require a lot of infrastructure, so as long as it's aimed at communities, people are receiving it very positively. "_
Barbados is the home of the famous godfather of tennis, Deighton “Pa” Roach. Road tennis is widely played on the island, and it has already been successfully exported to California, USA. Rwanda is the first African country to host this sport.
"I love playing this very special sport, whenever I find time in the evening I come and play. I love the concept of adopting a new game from another country, it's good to learn something new."
Rwandan sports officials say the game is very affordable and can be played by anyone, provided they have the space.

                                                      Launch of works to build Madagascar's first motorway
                                                                                    -  
Authorities in Madagascar have started works on the country's first motorway linking the capital, Antananarivo, to Tamatave, the country's economic hub and largest port.
Egyptian company Samcrete will be in charge of the 4-year project for a budget of nearly $1 billion.
"The highway will allow us to relieve the congestion of the national road number 2 because in fact it is estimated that the traffic will be multiplied by 5 in the next three years. So it will be unbearable for the national road number 2 to handle this extra traffic", said Public Works Minister of Madagascar, Jerry Hatrefindrazana.
The project has sparked controversy amongst the population. Farmers are one group particularly affected.
"We are in the middle of the rice transplanting period, right at the moment when our rice fields will be destroyed. And we have been waiting for the state to take action for us farmers. In all the speeches, no official spoke about the farmers", complained farmer Roland Edie Rakotodramasy.
Others, like teacher Pauline Ramialisoa, remain convinced about the overall benefits.
"Traffic will be faster, cars will not use much gasoline, and the transport of goods from inside and outside will be more fluid", she said
One of the Egyptian companies involved in the project, EGAAD, stressed the environmental advantages of the new infrastructure.
"This highway that will link the capital to the main port, the economic hub of the country, will ease a lot of things, reducing an 11-hour journey to a 2.5-hour journey. It will help to reduce CO2 emissions by 25 to 30%", claims EGAAD group president, Reda Boulos.
The first stage of the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the president's mandate in 2023.

                                                                                    -  
A new Chinese-built expressway in the Kenyan capital Nairobi will help boost the economy of the African nation, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for transportation and infrastructure, James Wainaina Macharia, said on Saturday.
The expressway opened to traffic for trial runs on Saturday and is expected to increase local employment, ease traffic jams, and bring a raft of economic benefits to the notoriously congested city.
Macharia hailed the expressway as one of the 'best pieces of infrastructure' ever built on the African continent.
"This road will have a very, very big impact in terms of mobility of Kenyans, visitors, businessmen, businesswomen, tourists. This is one of the best pieces of infrastructure ever done in Africa. In fact, it’s the longest expressway in Africa. So we are very proud today (Saturday) to come to witness the start of the trial run and monitor to make sure that indeed the expressway will be operated seamlessly and to a very high standard," he said.
The expressway stretches 27 kilometres through the heart of Nairobi, connecting Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Nairobi's Central Business District, the National Museum and the Presidential Palace.
More than 10,000 people have already registered to use the expressway, with an average of 800 people registering every day.
"Definitely, I will use it often. It's convenient, and hopefully, it will remain like that for the rest of its lifetime," said one Nairobi motorist.
The expressway is already creating direct employment opportunities for Nairobi's workers, with employees at the state-of-the-art expressway monitoring centre welcoming the opportunity to learn new technologies and software that keep the road running smoothly.
"We are doing the traffic monitoring and coping with the automatic detection system. We are able to detect if there is any congestion in the expressway if there is any pedestrian crossing if there is any vehicle reversing in the expressway. And thus, we are able to reach out to the responsible department to handle the abnormality on the expressway. We provide our country with a very smart, smooth and safe and speedy travel experience. We are able to learn a lot of software here as we learnt about the software which enables the cameras. Also, in the monitoring centre, I've learnt some Chinese words," said Martha, an employee working at the expressway monitoring centre.
The 73.5 billion shillings (about $648 million) road is expected to cut travel time from the south to the west of Nairobi to about 20 minutes from two hours currently during peak time.
The expressway was financed and built by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership model. Full-scale construction of the infrastructure project began in September 2020 and was completed a year ahead of schedule.
Building the expressway created more than 6,000 direct jobs, benefiting 200 sub-contractors and hundreds of other local suppliers of building materials such as steel, sand, cement and ballast.

                                                      Kenyan President William Ruto will ask China for a $1 billion loan to complete stalled road projects.
                                                                                    -  
Kenyan President William Ruto will ask China for a $1 billion loan to complete stalled road projects when he travels to Beijing later this month, his deputy Rigathi Gachahua said Friday.
Speaking on local radio Inooro FM, Gachahua said that Ruto will also ask for a longer repayment period for the money that is already owed. 
Ruto's plan is a marked shift in his stance, after his coalition previously criticised his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta's borrowing spree from China.
Unpaid billsKenyatta used the Chinese loans to fund infrastructure projects, such as the Nairobi expressway, but many of these projects have since stalled as contractors abandon them due to unpaid bills. 
"If we get $1 billion we can be able to give these people [contractors] the money they are owed so they can return so even as we pay the debt, the roads are completed," Gachahua said.
The deputy said Ruto will ask Chinese officials if Kenya can be given more time to repay the debts. 
Belt and Road InitiativeKenya was one of many countries on the continent that were a focus of China's Belt and Road Initiative, an ambitious project launched in 2013 by President Xi Jinping to extend Chinese geopolitical and economic influence through a global infrastructure development push. 
But the surge in Chinese loans to countries like Kenya, before a slowdown in Chinese lending from 2019, has angered critics, pushed up debt loads and the subsequent repayment burden.
The Kenyan government is spending roughly half of its revenue to repay debts that are falling due, official data shows, straining its finances. The situation has been compounded by foreign debt repayments, amid a steep weakening of the Kenyan currency.
The cabinet ordered all ministries to cut 10% of their budget on Tuesday, while the president's office imposed some restrictions on foreign travel by government officials to rein in expenditure.
"It is true that many people have been travelling abroad, spending a lot of money, and that is why the president ordered that even ministers and governors can only travel with two people," Gachagua said.

Two projects were highlighted in Sydney, Australia for being investment ready projects in PNG.As part of the decarbonisation program in PNG Tasman Environmental Markets (TEM) Chief Customer Officer Adrian Enright highlighted the two programs making headway in the country.“The April Salumei REDD is 600, 000 hectares of a project.”According to information gathered, the April Salumei REDD Project is the pilot project for Papua New Guinea.Its aim is to protect the forest and biodiversity of the area (603,579ha) whilst providing an important source of income for the traditional owners.The traditional owners have formed the April Salumei Working Group to assist with the management of the project.About 60 per cent of all revenue goes directly to the landowners who actively determine the allocation of funds to activities such health care, education facilities, infrastructure and the development sustainable agricultural activities for the local people whilst preserving the rich cultural traditions and culture.Mr Enright said that the biodiversity in PNG is bigger with the April Salumei project continuing to have significant community flow.He spoke of another project known as Clean Cook Stoves Project which is largely implemented currently in Southern Highlands.By way of decarbonisation he highlighted that the, “technology is cleaner with the old way of cooking over fire causing the burning of fuel which is about 90 per cent still associated of timber use.”“The Cook Stoves Project is reducing emissions by felling the wood and collecting less. Cook Stoves is also seeing respiratory benefits reduced and it is significant,” Mr Enright said.“Decarbonisation journey is multi-facitated and it is strongly recommended for organisations look beyond carbons.”

Algeria partners China for construction of 6,000km railway lines

                                                                                    -  
China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the "best guarantee of development", stressing that "our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km." The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
"China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner," said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
"The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth," he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
"As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities," said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
"This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone," echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

Rwanda is investing heavily in sports through partnerships with clubs such as Arsenal and PSG and the organization of the World Road Cycling Championships in 2025. However this strategy has drawn criticism from the opposition, which doubts it is usefull for the economy of the 73rd FIFA Congress host country.
First, it was a multi-million dollar sponsorship of English Premier League club Arsenal in 2018, followed by a splashy deal to back French giants Paris Saint-Germain a year later. The "Visit Rwanda" can now be seen on Premier League and Ligue 1 pitches.
The vision of Rwandan authorities takes shape with club sponsorships and hosting duties for events ranging from 2021’s Basketball Africa league tournament to cycling’s Road World Championships in 2025.
It has required extensive work to provide the country with new sports infrastructure: $104 million for a 10,000-seat basketball hall, $16 million for a golf course inaugurated in 2021 in Kigali, and $165 million budgeted for the ongoing construction of the National Stadium, which is expected to expand from 25,000 to 45,000 seats by 2024.
President Paul Kagame has spent a small fortune on sports investments that he says will burnish the international image and diversify the economy of the tiny eastern African country.
But the splurge has drawn accusations of “sports-washing”. Campaigners accuse Kagame of crushing political dissent and stifling free speech during his more than 22 years in power.
Improve standard of living"These investments do not meet the immediate needs of the vast majority of Rwandans," said opposition politician Victoire Ingabire, a fierce critic of Kagame.
"I don’t believe there is return for his investments," she told AFP, saying that the sponsorships did little to help rural Rwandans. "It is wasted money."
In the eastern African ccountry, per capita income is estimated at just $822 according to 2021 World Bank figures.
Government officials have defended the projects, arguing that they serve to bolster the country’s reputation as a safe destination for high-profile events.
Pre-pandemic tourism revenues jumped 17 percent to $498 million in 2019, according to Rwanda Development Board.
The board’s CEO, Clare Akamanzi, said at the weekend that the Arsenal and PSG sponsorship deals alone had generated over $160 million in media value. This had in turn brought one million visitors to Rwanda, injecting $445 million in tourism revenues, she added.
"These guests not only left Rwanda with positive memories; they also played a direct role in improving peoples’ lives," she wrote in an opinion piece published Saturday in the East African newspaper.
Fearless"It’s alright to disagree with Rwanda’s governance model, but a campaign to undermine investment in a developing country’s economy, which has a real impact on the lives (of) people, is counterproductive and cynical," she adde.
For Kagame — an ardent Arsenal supporter — the deals had surpassed "by far what we invested", he said this month, adding that the government was on the verge of sponsoring a third team.
And world football’s governing body FIFA will be in town this week for its 73rd congress to reelect its chief Gianni Infantino who is running unopposed.
Authorities say such events bring in much-needed foreign exchange and provide an economic boost to the landlocked nation which is reliant on tourism.
Ruling party MP John-Ruku Rwabyoma echoed her sentiments in an interview with AFP, charging that critics of the deal were "ignorant" and that the government was acting in the best interest of its people.
"We are not here to satisfy critics based on their agenda. Where were all these critics when Rwanda was suffering?"
A foreign diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity told AFP he was skeptical about the claims.
"I don’t know whether it is cost-effective… whether it is paying off in the long run, maybe then, but now, I do not think so," he said, adding that he had not seen the numbers to support the government’s narrative.
Nonetheless, doubts raised by "pundits who mostly know next to nothing about Rwanda, and draw upon tired tropes" will do little to stop the initiatives, according to Clare Akamanzi.
"We will not be bullied into ceding our place at the table," she said.
