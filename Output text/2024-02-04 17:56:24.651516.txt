PNG Prime Minister James Marape will make history when he addresses the Federal Parliament at the invitation of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Australians believe in tradition which they keep strenuously. History is also something we should all believe in to understand the future. In looking forward to the upcoming event, here’s some background stuff.The Independent State of Papua New Guinea is a Pacific Melanesian nation of eight million people. Other Melanesian States are the former British Solomon Isles, Vanuatu, formerly French New Hebrides, New Caledonia and Fiji.In the Pacific are also Micronesian and Polynesian nations. In terms of world map, Papua New Guinea lies at the tip of Australia’s Far North Cape York Peninsula facing the Equator. Papua New Guinea or PNG is Australia’s nearest neighbour, closer than the Muslim State of Indonesia with whom PNG shares a common land border.At the extreme western end of the island of New Guinea, it is only a 10-minute boat ride to the Australian islands of Boigu and Saibai in the Torres Strait. Due to their closeness to the PNG mainland; there are traditional border crossings which is tolerated by Australia, just as happens on the land border at Vanimo on the PNG side and the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya.Irian Jaya was annexed by the Dutch but on departure at the first half of the 20th Century, handed over the indigenous Melanesians to Indonesia. The New Guinea part of the island annexed by the Germans was ‘given up’ basically, just before full-scale hostilities broke out to start WWII in PNG.Australia then assumed control over New Guinea as part of its jurisdiction over the mandated Trust Territory of Papua. After WWII, the protectorate became the Territory of Papua-New Guinea. The mandate to Australia was arranged by Britain at the United Nations because Britain said it was too far away to keep an eye on Papua.Papua was initially a British Protectorate and when mandated to Australia became its territory. The United Nations (UN) came into being as a result of loss of life and damage to economies experienced during WWII, as well as the hangover of WWI. Leaders of nations desiring peace came together to broker peace and the UN was born.It was at this time that decolonisation started and PNG happened to be at the right place at the right time. What triggered the avalanche was the change in political boundaries in the aftermath of the two great wars.
DECOLONISATIONThe assumption of responsibility over New Guinea invariably helped Australia because it demonstrated Australia’s resolve, proved its tenacity and this led to federation when ‘big brother’ Britain saw that Australia was indeed capable. Australia, as a fledgling nation itself had meager resources to be able to look after a dependency. But the belief was that ‘New Guinea’ was a territory of Australia and this paved the way for the recognition Australia needed to become the influence it got to be.Responsibility over New Guinea invariably helped AustraliaThe effects of the two World Wars affected Australia badly and as decolonisation swept the globe, Australia also warmed to the concept of peace and saw decolonisation as a necessary step in that direction. There was something else that invariably came into play as a political justification for the hand moving toward decolonisation.In the Second World War, Australia, like most people of the European race tend to do, went to meet the enemy half way – not to allow the enemy to set foot on home soil as that would amount to an invasion. Australia, to the Japanese who proved their skill as jungle fighters in the China and Korean wars, was a relatively easy topography. To allow the Japanese to set foot in Australia would not only spell disaster but, also, whatever the outcome waited at the end, national pride and sovereignty were at stake. By taking the fight to the enemy resolved these issues and New Guinea being Australia’s property was the place to engage the enemy.
DEFENCE OF AUSTRALIAAustralia fought in New Guinea to defend itself first and second, its territory. Since New Guinea is at the corridor to Australia, it became a strategic defence point for Australian security. It still is. When Douglas MacArthur was General Officer Commanding the South – West Pacific Theatre of War, this was how the defence of Australia was largely seen also; to block the advance of the Japanese in New Guinea.What actually won the day for the Allied forces was their battle strategy. Australia would take care of the air assault and the infantry and the US; the navy. The naval blockade prevented Japanese reinforcements and supplies from getting through as well as stifled any chances of retreat and regrouping. The hastily-trained Australians who flew US -supplied airplanes paid a certain price. But apart from the mop-up operations, Australia will forever relish in its war effort, notably the Battles of Kokoda, Gona and Buna-Sananada, all in the Northern Province of PNG. There were other engagements but none are more closer to the heart of Australians than these three battles.Kokoda was not only a hell of a place to fight because of its unforgiving terrain but it was also the last line of defence before Port Moresby, after which, the Japanese, if they advanced that far, would have had Australia within their sight. This was where the Fuzzy-Wuzzy Angel legend was born, and is today, the proudly- shared heritage of PNG and Australia.
SHARED INDEPENDENCEPNG on its part lacks the ability to adequately protect its borders even though new legislation has come into place. It will need Australian assistance in that regard and it is in the mutual interest of both countries to remain good and effective neighbours, the basis of which is the common heritage they share.PNG is politically independent. Socially, well; once a home-grown economic model is devised and put in place, it may lead to a clearer definition of its national character, beliefs and value systems. Economically, advancement in this sector is contingent on the social institutions being developed because they are already a part of the scenario whether PNG is industrialised or not.The country’s economy is still under customary traditions and beliefs but the fact that PNG is already a player on the world stage with borders crashing and the world becoming one global village, there is need to look at the social institutions- viz a viz – The family, economy, government and law, education and religion. All five are interconnected and herein lies the chance of developing national character and establishing its belief and value systems.PNG’s national economy, however, cannot be isolated from the world. One of the biggest challenges facing PNG is the human capacity and education, especially tertiary education, needed to empower citizens to engage in building the nation’s social structure. The PNG government is very much aware of this as a way of lifting the quality of life of its people and is hinting on people capacity-building as the basis of its economy rather than a service-driven economy.
In the colonial era the question – in whose interest was the PNG economy being built – was asked; the Papua New Guineans or the people who risked their money there? Australians like Gough Whitlam, Kim Beazley, Sir Paul Hasluck and C E Barnes were bold men, well-meaning and adventurous in their diplomacy toward the question of PNG independence.
That question of long ago still lingers. But the reality is that the policy of a Minister is like the economist’s view – always juggling between ideas to come to an agreement while the influencing factors are relentlessly active in their own way. The layman’s view is that the market economy has a lot to say about that. But again, it depends on political correctness and the prevailing circumstances. All anyone on both side of the Torres Strait can do is to take a bow in humble gratitude.
HOME RULEHome rule for PNG began as an idea. The idea initially came from the Federal Opposition. The Federal Opposition Leader in 1970 was Gough Whitlam and championing the cause of self determination for PNG saw him become prime minister two years later when Labor came into power.Whitlam arrived in the Territory and commenced his two-week tour on New Year’s Day, 1970. In Port Moresby he had consultations with leading territory figures, visited the university and later had a long briefing with senior army men including the commander of the Papua-New Guinea Command, Brigadier-General Eldridge. Later he had talks with several Port Moresby businessmen and senior Banking officials.The Australian said in an editorial: “Mr Whitlam’s target dates for home rule and Independence in New Guinea have crystalised steadily between the Government and Opposition. The Labor policy highlights two facts of life which the government refuses to face. First, the decision on when New Guinea is to become independent is not one for New Guinea alone. The time may well come when Australian opinion is not prepared to pay the political price of gradualism.And second, that the time left for the transfer of power is, in any event, extremely short. Discussion of New Guinea, such as it is, is the politician’s tendencies to conduct it in terms of sublime altruism. Australia’s national interests are just as much involved in the Independence issue as New Guinea’s. Both the Government and Opposition tacitly recognise the fact even if they define the interests differently.A definite date for home rule is vital and there seems nothing wrong with Mr Whitlam’s suggestion of 1972. Full Independence will inevitably follow soon afterwards. Perhaps after two years’ experience, could indicate how soon. But what is so clearly needed before either of these steps is removal of the dead-hand remote control system in Canberra which deprives even the present administration of independence, authority and proper exemplary value. Until the Administration has visible power that can be handed over to the native peoples, Independence will remain a half-myth in New Guinea”.Kim Beazley, the Labor Member for Freemantle accompanied Whitlam on the Opposition Leader’s tour of the Territory. From his report which he gave to the Post Courier, the campaign for Independence in New Guinea was focused on what he called the gunboat diplomacy of the key players ‘at row boat speed’ and directed at the Government, it turned the tide in Whitlam’s favour. Here is an excerpt from that report by Mr Beazley.“Increasingly, Papua-New Guinea is being run for the foreign investor. And the certain signal of the restoration of this imperial technique is the restoration of the imperial technique – the punitive expedition.” Beazley pointed out that in 1969 a punitive expedition using batons and tear gas sought to force the Rorovanas to sell their land to CRA at a price satisfactory not to themselves but to the Administration. After the visit to Canberra of Bougainville leaders Paul Lapun, MHA (Member of House of Assembly) and Raphael Bele, to tackle the conscience of the Government, Prime Minister Gorton ordered the Administration and its punitive expedition out of the affair. The natives then negotiated for themselves a deal 20 times better than did the Administration, which alleged itself to be protecting their interest.“Another punitive expedition of 1000 police went to deal with Mataungan Association members among the Tolai of New Britain. Again, Mr Gorton reversed the policy of the Administration. The 11,000 Tolai addressed by Mr Whitlam were a manifestation of growing land pressure in the Gazelle. The Minister for Territories, Mr C E Barnes has been subject to severe press criticism. When he is led by his heart and conscience, he is a winner in policy and wins the heart of native leaders”. Beazley said he had seen Mr Barnes do it. “Led by the advice of the hard-eyed economic developer, however, his policy somehow always ended in violent clashes.The Hasluck policy of equal pay for equal qualification had been discarded. It was in fact an Australian promise repudiated. Defending his policy in the House of Representatives on September 30, 1959, Mr Hasluck said: ‘Anyone – if there is anyone – who still thinks of New Guinea people as a mass of cheap labour to work for his sole advantage, and without ambition or claims of their own, not only is living in a fool’s paradise, but is basically building a fool’s hell.”“In conflicts with the most advanced sections of the people we have twice come to violent clash – the fool’s hell. So far Mr Gorton has intervened to avert the worst twice. This caprice is symptomatic of the loss of policy coherence since Sir Paul left the Ministry.” (Hasluck became the Governor-General).Sir Paul, advising the House of Representatives said: “The Territory of Papua-New Guinea is developing economically and will in future develop faster. But the level of local saving in Papua-New Guinea is low and finance for the major development projects comes predominantly from outside the Territory. Because of this, the Administration has in the past acquired – for future disposal to the people of the Territory – substantial equity holdings in certain enterprises, notably the Bougainville copper project and the New Britain palm oil project.“My government now proposes to ask the Territory House for legislation to establish a statutory corporation to acquire equity in major investment projects in the Territory. This new institution will have a close link with the Papua – New Guinea Development Bank. My Government will this month introduce a new scheme to practical, down to earth training of Papuans and New Guineans in Australia, in areas of training not available in the Territory”.In outlining the Government’s program Sir Paul said that the Government did not believe that an arbitrary date for Independence should be set by it. Even against the wishes of the people it will not do so, he said. “But my Government does believe in constant advancement towards self-government”, Sir Paul said.
INDEPENDENCE IN CONTINUATIONWe’ve seen so far that independence for PNG is in continuation. There is no question about its sovereignty and the business of governing the people and managing the nation which are continuing with remarkable success in some areas. But until a safe mark is reached where PNG will completely stand on its own, Australia is very much a part of the political, economic and social landscape of its neighbour. The colonial past and the obligations there make this inevitable and if Australia were to look in disdain to PNG’s struggles, its reputation would suffer. It is not ‘interference,’ rather, it is national conscience. Independence for PNG means as much to Australia as does to PNG so ours is a shared independence.
It is safe that way as this condition acts as a catalyst for strong bilateral relations. It’s hard to imagine that Australian budgetary support will be reduced or cut off completely. The Australian taxpayers can speak at the polls and political parties in Australia are acutely accountable to the voter so the riches in the mineral and petroleum sector may give the impression that we in PNG are making inroads. We bring the Australian people back to our earlier point that PNG needs to build its capacity.

Loyalty is what PNG women’s football team skipper Ramona Padio best describes their 6th gold medal win against Fiji on Friday night.
In front of a packed Solomon Islands National Stadium, Padio led the team to another stunning performance to defeat the shattered Fijians 4-1. 
Prior to attending the 17th Pacific Games, Padio confidently said with confidence during Team PNG’s farewell function at the Sir John Guise stadium in Port Moresby that they will retain the gold medal.
“I publicly announced that we will win the gold medal. We fulfilled our dream of bringing the gold medal back to PNG,” said Padio.
The unavailability of central defender Serah Waida due to conceding a red card following the 5-1 semifinal win over Samoa, saw the players feeling down that she (Waida) will not play in the gold medal play off.
Mentally the players believed in each other and Padio said they have players in the team who can step up and fill the void left by Waida.
Padio said the team executed what was expected from them by coach Frederica Sakette and the coaching staff.
“We followed the instructions of the coach and further we had this rope tied to our head to win this sixth gold medal,” said Padio.
From the match itself, the opening 45 minutes of play was an evenly contested encounter.
Fiji kept mounting pressure on PNG with their quick passing style of play but the defensive efforts of Olivia Upaupa, goalkeeper Faith Kasiray, Georgina Bakani and Rumona Morris shut them down.
The only change in the tempo came from when PNG’s Phylis Pala scored the only goal of the first half for PNG to lead 1-0 to half-time.
Several opportunities swayed, however, Kasiray held firm, as did her counterpart at the other end.
From the resumption of play, fatigue from the one-week competition kicked in and started to affect the Fijians defense, with the smaller PNG women taking full advantage.
PNG ran riot from left to right with Padio and Morris dictating the offence in the midfield.
Coach Frederica Sakette and assistant coach Erickson Komeng were both vocal on the sideline to maintain the pressure as they could see the Fijians struggling to manage PNGs counter-attack.
Finally a Marie Kaipu solo effort off the back of good team build-up saw her outpace three Fijian defenders and the goalkeeper before nudging the ball to take a handy 2-0 lead.
The Fijians were by then physically drained and were basically running on empty.
Kaipu by this time was having fun and was not long before she landed her second goal and then Calista Maneo the fourth to silence the vocal Fijian crowd and bench.
Fiji could only manage to score one goal, as PNG totally dismantled their normally well oiled outfit, to pull off another historical gold medal milestone.
The PNG women have now won the prestigious Pacific Games title since its inception in 2003 in Fiji, next in Apia, Samoa in 2007, then in New Caledonia in 2011, in Port Moresby in 2015, back to Apia in 2019 and then Honiara in 2023.
Previous coaches were the likes of Steven Mune, Francis Moyap and Garry Philips that have ensured that reign for the past 24 years.

PMV is the abbreviation for Passenger Motor Vehicle. That is the common passenger carrying permit issued by MVIL.
It is a common abbreviation that has become a word used for public or passenger motor vehicles across the nation. Its business history is old then the independence history of the nation of PNG.
As far as memory can recollect, PMV’s has been moving this nation’s economy since 1950, 5 years after the war.
My Dad had an old Japanese troop Jeep that was left after the war which he fixed and used as a PMV.
PMV’s rise each morning as early as 3 am and shuts down as late as 12midnight. PMV’s have been part and partial of this nations historic development to date. As a young boy growing up, I learned the mechanics of a PMV business from my Dad.
The first passengers for my dad’s PMV runs very early each day were the air and sea travelers.
They needed to be at the airports and seaports for their early departures.
After those runs, dad’s PMV, by then he had bought a long body green Dyna truck and built wooden seats, would ferry day students to schools.
After the school runs, the PMV would leave the urban boundary for rural passengers since the buses buses were unable to undertake the rough rural roads.
Main cargo to be moved from the rural communities were fresh garden foods for the urban markets.
Many mothers preferred to begin their journey to the urban markets as early as 5am in the morning, so that they can secure the better selling pots at the markets.
Dad was illiterate so he used an old Japanese custom of tying knots to a rope he kept to remind him of the bookings made for his PMV to transport goods to the markets or hire pickups.
Hire pick-ups consist of copra or cocoa bags which were transported to the Copra Marketing Board warehouse or Cocoa Marketing Board for quality checks and repacking for exports. Old habits die hard.It’s been seventy-three years after Dad used an old Jeep as a PMV.
The PMV history, progress and habits has not changed much except in the type of vehicles used. Roads and bridges remain rough, and until passengers get into the urban boundary, they do not have the luxury of any comfortable travelling in buses.
PNG’s history and progress will remain entrenched with the movement of cargo, business and people with PMVs.
The character, style and business habits of PMV’s is the same from West Sepik to Milne Bay to Gulf and inland throughout the Highlands region.
Today’s PMVs are laden with poultry, livestock, garden produce, betel nut, root crops, working class, travelling class, building materials, students etc,.. entering and leaving the city each and every day.
The PMV has been and remains the backbone of moving domestic cargo, subsistence agriculture, wounded, dying and dead, tourists, party goers, church worshippers, social events as well as business events, from sunset to sunrise in lightning, thunder, wind and rain for decades.
The nation, on a micro-economic scale has been and still is being moved by the PMV.PMV’s are the silent and silhouetted regiment of citizens that will never stop moving this nation forward.
Habits may change, the face of the PMV may change, but their needs and service will be needed for eternity. Image if the PMV’s stop running.
PNG should consider a PMV Festival or better still, a Holiday to celebrate the PMV’s immense contribution to nation building.

OPPORTUNITY is a big word. It knocks on your door if you are lucky. If you are unlucky, it will not knock on the door but will hang in the “AIR”…take it or leave it.
Choice is yours. Fact is. It comes only once. If you do not take it, it passes and evaporates and will not return in the form and shape it did.
PNG sits Geo-Politically blessed, now than it ever did. It has become a centre of attraction between Australia and China.
Stepping back in time, between December 7th 1941 until September 2nd 1945, another Asian country was engaged in a regional crusade to take control of the pacific and PNG became its entry and exit in that era.
Its desire was to compete with the industrialised nations of western Europe and the United States.
Other non-guilty but responsible nations mentioned by recorded history in the pacific crusade were Great Britain, Australia, New Zealand, China, France and the Soviet Union.Caught with their pants down, was the unfortunate pacific people and the main landmass utilised during that crusade was PNG, a Colony during that “’patch of grass’’ era.
Seventy-eight years later, forty-eight of which as an Independent sovereign nation, the landmass known as PNG again sits as a bridge of another tussle, an economic tussle. 
PNG needed a shake to alert United Nations after the pacific tussle that the nation needed sovereignty so that the fuzzy wuzzy’s can take control of their own political destiny.
A champion political Knight appeared in his shining armour and pursued political independence which landed on PNG’s laps on 16th September 1975.
Beyond that era, PNG is craving for another Knight with an economic armour that can enable Papua New Guinea to develop itself with much needed physical infrastructure across the whole country that will enable BUSINESS and TRADE to prosper.PNG needs it.
A war that is opportune. Its timing is very right and necessary that the nation’s young generation managers must ensure that national sovereignty is not compromised in this “LOOK NORTH” commercial interest.
PNG needs it, not so much in an invasion type relationship, but selected economic investments across the country, not just Port Moresby.
The nation has recently signed a defence agreement with United States and more recently visited China a short distance to the North, for the economic opportunities that is available.
PNG was responding to a formal invitation by China to attend the Third Belt and Road Forum for International Development and Cooperation. A package bundle that is worth billions of Kina.
PNG signed agreements to receive China’s financial assistance targeting Economics, trade Enhancement, Education and other fluid bundle of “As is where is’’ financial assistance.
While the Roundtable News Desk in London, quoted a former PNG Diplomat in London who described this whole development as “two elephants playing on a patch of grass and its people are that patch of grass” is a very realistic perception. 
The quote went on to describe the December 1941 to September 1945 pacific conflict crusade as a comparison of Papua New Guineans as by-standers, it will be fair and just to say that, back then the “patch of grass were by-standers.”
Not anymore. That “patch of grass” is now fully grown and fortunately have prickles after 78 years of experience with forty-eight years of it as a sovereignty with an identity and backbone.
It’s time to play our blessings as the bridge, not over river Kwai this time BUT strategically and geo-politically connecting the East to the West across the south pacific trade route.
It’s a blessing by making, not by default. It’s the country’s blessing.
This time, no colonialist will be dictating but Papua New Guineans taking charge of its own destiny as that “patch of grass”.
When the nation feels that any of the elephants are stamping too hard, all it needs to do is prickle its feet and the elephant will feel the pinch.
The economic opportunity is right and now to progress the nation. PNG must take it.

The North Sydney Bears losing $11 million in promised NSW government funding has put PNG in the box seat to be named the 18th NRL side.
The funding promised by Dom Perrottet’s ousted Liberal government in the lead up to this year’s state election has been scrapped by new Labour premier Chris Minns.
On the other hand, the federal government has financially backed PNG to join the NRL in a move made by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to improve international relations.
PNG Prime Minister James Marape asked the Australian Government for an NRL team by 2025 to mark the 50th anniversary of his country’s independence – and Albanese is determined to deliver it.
Albanese wants a Port Moresby-based team, with games to also be played in Cairns, as a way to counter China’s growing influence in the region.
Australia’s Pacific Minister Pat Conroy in July committed $5.5 million to help PNG prepare a business case for their NRL bid and develop a pipeline of players.
Albanese has reportedly indicated privately that his government is prepared to help underwrite a team with up to $25 million a year from the foreign aid budget.
The PNG Hunters joined the Queensland Cup in 2014 and won the title 2017 – the same year the national side made the quarterfinals of the Rugby League World Cup.
PNG hosted the Australia’s PM’s XIII in Port Moresby last month and the Kumuls more than held their own against a side full of NRL stars.
They then thrashed the Cook Islands last weekend in their Pacific Championships opener as PNG’s expansion bid builds serious momentum.
Andrew Hill is the lead consultant for PNG’s bid and told foxsports.com.au that the Australian government support was a “game changer”.
“The bid itself is not being run an individual but by the government of PNG,” Hill said.
“It could (go ahead without Albanese’s support) but there’s no doubt having both the Australian and the PNG government involved is a game changer.”
On the back of the Dolphins successful entry in the NRL this year, there were reports on Thursday that the Kumuls could join the competition as soon as 2025.
But Hill emphasised, however, that whoever wins the next NRL licence, it would only be announced by 2025 and the side would enter the NRL closer to 2027.
The Australia Government in August announced it would tip in $7 million to help fund the inaugural Pacific Championship, a tournament involving men’s and women’s teams from Australia, Cook Islands, Fiji, New Zealand, Samoa, Papua New Guinea and Tonga.
The bid team are focusing on an outright PNG team, but a Pasifika model is also being considered.
Samoa and Parramatta captain Junior Paulo has previously said he would play for a Pasifika NRL side.
“While we think rugby league in the Pacific is far stronger, it gives us the confidence to discuss what a Pacific team may look like.
“Obviously PNG would be leading those discussions, but clearly the genuine goal of the PNG government is to get more content in PNG and a licence based there.

Prime Minister James Marape flew out last Sunday to Jerusalem hoping to boost foreign investment and to strengthen the Christian bond between Israel and Papua New Guinea.
With a delegation comprised of church and business leaders, PM Marape officially open the new embassy in Jerusalem, in response to local church groups that have lobbied for a firmer relationship with Israel for so long.
When PM Marape was in Israel, news broke out that a Christian prayer warrior back home, “using the name of the Lord, started performing a prayer ritual and was describing and naming people in the village who she claimed had satanic powers and were killing and causing people to get sick, have bad luck and struggle in finding education, finding jobs and doing business”.
Upon the prayer warrior’s words, a community in Bulolo, Morobe Province, went bonkers and tortured a 39-year-old mother to her death. She was suspected of possessing satanic powers and of being a witch.
It is hard to accept that such a barbaric killing should occur in Morobe, the stronghold of the Evangelical Lutheran Church, which has quickly condemned the killing.
PNG joined a handful of countries that have established embassies in Jerusalem, following the commitment by PM Marape on the National Prayer and Repentance Day on August 26.
He also told the country a law would be introduced to officially make PNG a Christian country.
The Government envisaged that a close relationship with Israel is essential for PNG’s aspirations in economy, agriculture, health and technology and a recognition of Israel’s claim to Jerusalem as its capital based on biblical and secular history.
We will have to wait to see the Palestinians, who claim Jerusalem as their territory, will react. We all should know about the feud between Israel and Palestine if we are Christians because the feud is ancient.
Australia and Britian had to withdraw their plans to set up embassies in Jerusalem, when Palestine protested, describing the move as a “blatant violation of international law”.
If by moving into Jerusalem, we anticipate divine intervention to really change the attitudes and behaviours of our people towards the escalating tortures and killings from sorcery related accusations, the gender-based violence and the tribal conflicts as well as the general lawlessness here, hopefully we see some miracles soon.
While we wait, we have to ask some critical questions as Christians. Where is the love? Where is the respect? Where is justice?
The Christian religion was introduced into PNG in the 1800s and by the 1930s, the early missionaries were all over the country, establishing churches and spreading the word of God.
Today the bible and its teachings are as old as the country and in our view, there is no need to preach about God or the Christian faith anymore. We believe in Him or we don’t, its simple as that.
How can our Churches in PNG contribute to a peaceful, united and prosperous PNG? This is the big question our churches here must ask themselves today, as we grapple with the challenges facing us.
Whatever is happening around the country may be happening because our people have lost their faith in God.
