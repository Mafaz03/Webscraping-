The Kokopo Central Business District’s Williams Road is gradually becoming more and more dotted with potholes.
On a busy day, the traffic stalls. Vehicles that attempt to avoid these potholes pose risks to pedestrians as they cross the main road to shops or the main market.
The main crossing from the Kokopo market to K Central supermarket is always busy and potholes have also riddled this main crossing.

Up until today, the idea has remained a dream that has yet to be realised.
Motorists, mainly those on route 8B PMV buses, are pleading with authorities to patch the potholes, as an accident along this route is deemed unavoidable.

It was a first of its kind in the history of the Telefomin people to access a new road.This new road from Tabubil, Western province connecting the first village, Urapmin in Telefomin district of West Sepik province was launched last Friday.The Urapmin villagers including nearby villages in the district and North Fly people, Tabubil and Kiunga turned out in numbers to witness the launching ceremony.Urapmin ward president Siniki Babeloki said it is a new beginning for them.“We have over 700 people in this village and we are so happy.“We walk for three days and nights to reach Tabubil.“We carry store goods, iron sheets, teaching materials and other things from Tabubil and walk back through the cold, foggy and rugged mountainous terrain to reach Telefomin.“Some of our people have died along this bush tracks.” he said.Mr Babeloki said seeing the machinery and trucks in the village is a joyous experience as the construction of the road means they can now reach Tabubil by truck and return home the same day.Telefomin district administrator Joshua Himina said the lack of road has been a major hindrance for delivery of services.However, this road will enable them to see more changes in the district.“New roads linking nearby villages will be done, health centres, schools and other services as well. All of these services are captured in our five -year development plan,” he said.It took six years since 2018 to construct road connecting Western and West Sepik provinces.Other eight kilometres of road construction from Urapmin village to Telefomin station will continue this month and further road construction will continue to Oksapmin rural LLG starting this year.The engineers from the contractor Ipwenz Construction Limited (IPZ), other sub- contractors with support from Ok Tedi Mine through the tax credit scheme under the Connect PNG program have helped established the road.Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, Minister for Works and Highways and Telefomin MP Solan Mirisim, Labour Minister and Rai Coast MP Kessy Sawang, Hela Governor Philip Undialu, OTML managing director Kedi Ilimbit and other dignitaries witnessed the event last Friday.

A THIRTY-six kilometre Ring Road Project in the Rigo North LLG of Rigo District in Central Province has been completed by Koia Investment Company Limited.
The Ring Road will now serve 20 council wards of North Rigo LLG who have been suffering from lack of better road access for the last 27 years. The Ring Road project was funded by the Central Provincial Government under the works program.
Present during the completion of the road last Sunday (27th August) were ), respective community leaders of Rigo North owner of the construction company Biari Ubuna, Acting Police Station Commander of Kwikila police station, Sergeant Bobby Ogara and a representative from the Rigo district development authority.
A community Leader Murray Gini thanked the constructor and the Central provincial government for providing the needed service to the 17, 000 plus population of Rigo North.
“The 20 council wards in the hinterland of Rigo District gratefully accolade praise to the management of KICL for the construction of Sivitatana – Wiga road connection,” Gini said.
“The road has been cut off for public use for about 27 years ago, which in other words can be put as political negligence for the last 5 terms by the previous governments.
“The Prime Minister James Marape declared the Rigo Inland Ring Road as Yagabo Highway when he was invited at Boregaina Village in late 2020 and he had announced K27 million for the road project.
In proceed to that announcement, this portion of the road was not accounted for and this has led our people to uncertainty of the effectiveness of government commitments.
“The people of Rigo North wish to give special thanks and accord to KICL, our sincere appreciation for the great achievement in bringing the road home to us.”
Biari thanked the leaders and people of Rigo North for working together with the constructor and successfully completed the project.
“The constructor is not here to make money but to deliver the needed service to the people of Rigo North.
Even though the scope of the road project ends at Dilikomana village, yet we have continued further for about 8 kilometres to Matanatou Sub Health Centre to fully connect the Ring Road. 
Biari further acknowledged and thanked the Central provincial government for making the funding available to complete the Ring Road project.

BY JOAN BAILEYA further K100 million has been committed by the Marape–Rosso Government to upgrade existing roads in Lae, the industrial capital of Morobe, in the coming years.Deputy Prime Minister and Lae MP John Rosso revealed this during the official launching of the Chinatown (Bumbu) Malahang road on Monday.
He said industrial roads and priority interior roads within the city will be considered under this funding because standard and good road condition are needed to complement the major developments in the city.Mr Rosso said this funding is expected to be made available by next year for more road construction, adding that as the Lae MP, his role is to secure funding and ensure it is available to the Department of Works and contractors to upgrade roads.“Funding is not easy to secure as all MPs, governors and development sectors are competing for a share of the funding from the National Government.
But I will try my best to maintain close consultation with Works and Highways Minister Solan Mirisim and secretary David Wereh, so hopefully we get some funding.“I am happy that our main road from Unitech to Tent City has been concreted followed by the Chinatown to Malahang Industrial Centre section of the Independence Drive,” he said.Mr Rosso said upgrading is now taking place on Mongola Street to a concreted high standard road.
He said plans are in place to secure funding for upgrading of Tent City to Busu Bridge and Second Seven dump to Bumayong roads to concrete roads in his second term in parliament.“Butibam to Kamkumung road will also be upgraded to concrete, while Kamkumung Bridge will be replaced with a new bridge to cater for four lanes.“Yalu Bridge has been contracted out already and work will begin soon to replace it with a new four lane bridge to complement the four lane Lae-Nadzab Highway.”Mr Rosso said in the last three years, the Pangu-led government has spent K3 billion on road constructions and they are committed to making roads accessible to the bulk of the population in the country.He also mentioned that the K400 million Yalu-Nadzab four-lane road project has been contracted out and work is progressing.

Remote Lower Lai village finally gets road link - Post Courier

BY PEARSON KOLOTHE last village of the Lower Lai constituency in the Wapenamanda Open Electorate in the Enga Province has finally been unlocked and connected to the outside world by road.This is after excavators from the Wapenamanda District Development Authority finally reached Tupokores, a village bordering Kompiam district and Baiyer Lumusa in the Western Highlands Province.
This road will continue into Lumusa and Baiyer and to Mt Hagen in due time.People living in these areas have shouldered coffee bags, garden produce and store goodsfor the past decades but these these struggles will be memories of the past as the road opens them up.This road construction is undertaken by Wapenamanda MP Miki Kaeok who is also the Vice Minister for Works and Highways.
Approximately 80 kilometres of roadworks have already been covered from Mambisanda near Wapenamanda to the last Tupokores village and will continue joining nearby Kompaim and eventually into Baiyer.This road is part of the National government’s Connect PNG road program and is expected to link Wapenamanda to Baiyer and to Madang through the Baiyer Madang Highway.

A historical and significant achievement under this medium term development progress of the govenrment is the delivery of the much-anticipated connectivity between the southern and northern parts of the country.Thanks to the government’s key infrastructure flagship program, Connect PNG, the 94km road construction that started in 2016 that connects Gulf, Southern Highlands and Hela, is now open for use.People who live in those rural enclaves can now seek markets with their rural produce through this connected-missing link.
The Aigiru Highway starts in Kikori, links the Okuk Highway and stops in either Lae or Madang.Prime Minister James Marape, who spent his Christmas and New Year on these highway, is grateful and pleased at this milestone achievement.“I thank the Works and Highways Department for connecting the South and the North through the opening up of the Erave Simberingi Road,” Mr Marape said.
“Over 60 per cent of this road link, which is called route 700, is sealed and though 40 per cent is not sealed, it is usable.“The government is committed to funding this road, and we hope to seal the remaining 40 per cent in this medium term,” Minister for Works and Highways Solan Mirisim added.He said the government remains committed to connect the missing links in the country, opening up all landlocked areas in the rural areas, and allow greater accessibility for people to enjoy benefits of government services and businesses.
“The govenrment has allocated a complete funding of K1.6 billion to the Department of Works and Highways, and we will ensure government priority roads are constructed to highest standard,” Mr Mirisim said.The Connect PNG 2020-2040 is a 20-years transport infrastructure development strategy intended to maintain, rehabilitate and construct strategic socio-economic development roads that will support farmers, tourism, schools, and health care centres and expand the benefits nationwide.The other national targeted roads includes, Baiyer to Madang, Telefomin to Tambul, East-West New Britain, and off course, the Trans Islands Highway, connecting Port Moresby to Highlands and Momase regions.

Prime Minister James Marape says least-developed districts like Koroba-Kopiago in Hela province are for the first time seeing development.He said this in Koroba last Friday when launching the sealing of the last section of the Highlands Highway from Halimbu Junction to Koroba at a cost of K88.89 million.A 10 per cent upfront payment of K8.889 million was made to the contractor on Friday to start work as well as K8 million for the contractor of another road from Maria to Kopiago.
This comes under the Marape government’s flagship “Connect PNG Program” with 30 per cent counterpart funding from Hela provincial government – despite it being a national project.“Koroba-Kopiagio is one of the least developed districts in PNG like Telefomin, Tari-Pori, Karimui, Goilala, Pomio, Kandrian-Gloucester, Nuku, Middle Ramu, Jimi, Samarai-Murua and Esa’ala,” Mr Marape told thousands of people at Koroba.“Over the last two years, we have given over K2 billion worth of contracts for infrastructure development throughout the country, with those in Hela including the roads from Komo to Halimbu, Ambua to Tari, and from Ambua to Mendi.
“Along the Highlands Highway, major roadworks have been completed, including two-lane bridges all the way from Lae to Mt Hagen.“The Works Minister and Works Secretary recently launched construction of the road from Vanimo to Aitape, and from Aitape to Wewak.“These are just a few of the many road projects being developed with this K2 billion.
“Over the next three years, we will be issuing another K5 billion worth of road projects throughout PNG, and Koroba is also included in this program.“The road from Halimbu Junction to Koroba is being built at a cost of K88 million, Maria to Kopiago K90 million, as well as various others.“I want this last section of the Highlands Highway from Halimbu to Koroba to be completed over the next five years so that you are no longer a ‘forgotten place’.“I am here to show you today that you are not forgotten by the Government of PNG.”Mr Marape thanked the Hela Provincial Government and Governor Philip Undialu for the 30 per cent counterpart funding.“This type of counterpart funding has never been done before for a national highway,” he said.“The road from Halimbu to Koroba is a national highway, however, I thank the Hela Provincial Government for bearing 30 per cent of the costs when it did not have to.”Mr Marape said this money will be reimbursed through the National Government funding a provincial road in Hela.He said what Hela had done was a good example for other provincial governments in the country to follow.

BY JEFFREY ELAPAThe Government’s vision to achieve 100 per cent road connectivity in PNG by 2040 has received a funding boost of K300 million, Works and Highways Minister Solan Mirisim (pictured) said.Mr Mirisim when giving a financing and progress update on the current connect PNG program of the Government said the additional funding will maintain good progress on ongoing works under the Connect PNG Economic Land Transport Infrastructure Development Program, popularly referred to as the “Connect PNG Program”.
He said the additional funding will also kick start upgrading works on six more new critical sections of the national road network on the Manus, East-West Highway, the New Britain Highway (East & West New Britain), the Magi Highway (Central & Milne Bay), the Ramu Highway (Madang & Morobe) and the Coastal Highway (East &West Sepik).He said the government has also fully retired the K600 million for capital works program as appropriated in the 2022 National Budget.This includes K300 million for provincial and district roads under a Sub-national Roads Development Program, separate from the Connect PNG Program.
“To date, all of the 2022 funding have been released in full as intended according in the 2022 Annual Work Plan,” he said.Mr Mirisim expressed his satisfaction on the overall performance of the Connect PNG Program, attributing the programs exceptional progress, to the government’s strong leadership and commitment, and the huge support from donors and development partners, with ongoing guaranteed funding support.He said transport infrastructure plays an important role in providing connectivity for our urban and rural communities, businesses and industries.
“Good roads play a crucial role in encouraging socio-economic development and progress of the country, as land transport accounts for over 80 per cent of national freight and passenger traffic volume,” he said.However he said the existing road network in the country has steadily fallen into a state of disrepair due to lack of maintenance over the last 20 years.The poor road network condition has become a brake on our economic development.Access to markets and service delivery have become much more difficult, travel time and vehicle operating costs for road users, are much higher than normal,” he said.However to address the challenge of recovering the condition of the road network and improve road connectivity for our citizens and businesses, the government approved in 2020, the 20-years Connect PNG Economic Road Infrastructure Development Program 2020-2040 that will cost a total of K20 billion.“The Connect PNG Programs long-term goal is to obtain ‘100 per cent Road Connectivity for PNG by 2040’. In the medium-term, the goal is to achieve a road link between the National Capital District with Morobe, Madang and the seven Highlands provinces, before the country’s 50th Independence anniversary,” he said.Mr Mirisim said: “The achievement of this road linkage by the September 2025 target date, will symbolise our national development, cohesion and unity over the past 50 years of independence, as well as achieve a significant development milestone, by connecting our two cities for the first time.This target will also enable our people on the mainland to travel affordably, to celebrate PNG’s Golden Jubilee in Port Moresby or their home province, as they wish.“In 2021, the National Parliament passed the Connect PNG (Implementation and Funding Arrangements) Act 2021.“The purpose of this Act is to legislate a guaranteed minimum funding for the Connect PNG Program, equivalent to 6.5 per cent of the annual budget, each year.Based on Treasury’s medium-term budget
Forecast for 2023-2027, the minimum funding translates to around Kl.4 billion annually, for the Programmes Phase 1 period up to 2027, inclusive.“The Connect PNG Program is Prime Minister Marape’s ‘flagship’ development program.“I am therefore thankful for the support and the importance the Prime Minister has accorded to the program since Cabinet approved it in 2020,” he said.Mr Mirisim said the program aims to rehabilitate and reconstruct 16,500 kilometres of economic roads and 1000 metres of bridges and other drainage structures that have deteriorated over time due to lack of regular maintenance.He said the program is also constructing Missing Link Roads (new economic road links) totalling around 4200 kilometres.Currently the Missing Link section of the Trans National Highway between Aseki, Morobe province and Epo, Gulf province is under construction.The completion of this road section will establish the strategic connection between Port Moresby and Lae City.The Connect PNG Program is being implemented in three Phases. Phase 1 is from 2020-2027 at K7.98 billion.

SECOND term Wabag MP and Health Minister Dr Lino Tom says all villages in Wabag district, Enga Province must be connected by road in order to have access to basic government services and associated developments.The Wabag District Development Authority has embarked on connecting the rural population which include neighbouring districts it shares borders with who have been living in the dark since the past like the Maramuni LLG.In his maiden term in office, Dr Tom connected the once neglected and isolated Maramuni LLG by road.
Meanwhile, work is being done to connect Angoram in East Sepik through the proposed Enga-Sepik Highway road project.The Kiwi-Anditale road project is a reliable road network connecting Wabag to the Upper Ambum area in the Kompiam-Ambum Electorate as more people live along this area.The Sopas-Yokonda road project is another impact road project that will connect the people of Upper Lai area in Wabag district with the people of the Surinki and Lagaip area in the Lagaip Open Electorate towards the west of Enga.
Another ongoing road project is the Birip-Aiyel Valley road project that has connected the Middle Lai area that starts in the Birip government station near the Wapenamanda/ Wabag electoral border and stretches into Aiyel Valley and Tsak Valley of the Wapenamanda Electorate.Recently, the Wabag DDA presented a new PC 210 excavator so the Yalu road can be further built linking last villages along the Wapenamanda-Wabag border stretching into areas of Tsak Valley in Wapenamanda.This new excavator will be used to further build the road through the Yalu mountain to make road access possible for more than 3000 people living there in isolation since time immemorial.
The Yalu-Aiyel Valley road will open up coffee markets as coffee is predominantly grown in these areas.The Yalu road in the Aiyel Valley was once the ancestral route taken by ancestors who traded foods and participated in other tribal obligations with the people of Tsak Valley in the Wapenamanda.The Yalu road once completed will help the people take a much shorter route to Tsak Valley and Wabag respectively.Most people in Wabag have been living without a road network since time immemorial pretending to live decent lives foolishly disguised by the provincial capital status of Wabag.In fact, Wabag district was 90 per cent inaccessible by road but this statistic has greatly improved since 2017 when Dr Tom won the Wabag Open Seat.Currently, approximately 35 per cent of the electorate is inaccessible by road which the Wabag District Development Authority will prioritise to make all of the electorate accessible by road by 2027.
