China’s Belt and Road Initiative has gained momentum since its commencement 10 years ago in 2013.
Initially it had a regional focus but rapidly expanded beyond central Asia towards the Middle East, Africa, South America, Eastern Europe and the Indo Pacific regions, making it the biggest such program since the Marshall Plan after World War II.
Logically, there was a sharp increase in the number of projects, total investments committed and executed, and the number of countries joining as partners. 
The current number of countries and organizations stand at over 150.
China stressed that the BRI was a new model for partnership, trade and integration that was free from hegemonic pressures and conditions. Later the principles of multilateralism, environment and sustainability were embedded in the BRI.
The West, fearing China’s rapid influence through the BRI, came up with competing initiatives such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (G7), the Global Gateway (EU), the Quality Infrastructure Investment Program (Japan), and others, but their ability to rival the BRI in scale is yet to be established.
As PNG joined these 150 other countries and organizations in Beijing this month to review their involvements in the BRI, the Post-Courier takes a brief look at three projects that have been rolled out in PNG under the auspices of the BRI.
The PNG national power grid, which includes a 132kV transmission and substations for Mt Hagen, Mendi, Tari, represents the first collaborative energy infrastructure endeavor between PNG and China under the Belt and Road Initiative.
This project closely aligns with PNG’s national energy strategy, which aims to increase electricity accessibility from the current 15% to 70% by 2030 and ultimately transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
The project is funded by the China Exim Bank and executed by the contractor TBEA Co., Ltd.
The project owner is PNG Power, the project scope consists of the construction of four new 132kV substations (Mt. Hagen, Pauanda, Mendi, and Tari) and a 180-kilometer 132kV transmission line connecting these substations.
Upon completion, it significantly increased the power grid coverage, effectively alleviated energy shortages, and greatly improved grid stability and reliability in the Highlands region.
The project directly benefits residents of the three Highlands provinces (Western Highlands Province, Southern Highlands Province and Hela Province) and provides power to adjacent mining projects, including gold and copper mines.
Consequently, it will efficiently stimulate economic growth in those regions connected by the power grid. 
This initiative can also meet the electricity demands of millions of households and residents, thus improving the quality of life for local communities.
Before 2015, due to the complex geographical environment and insufficient transportation infrastructure, internet access remained relatively expensive in PNG, with only about 12 percent of PNG residents connected to the internet.
There was no backbone network in PNG. The backbone communication network between islands was mainly low-bandwidth and high-cost transmission network such as satellite and microwave. The bandwidth was limited.
New services such as high-speed mobile Internet could not be launched. 
With the development of the local economy, the existed bandwidth could not meet the market requirements.
The PNG National Submarine Cable Network Project (NSCNP) was implemented by PNG DataCo Ltd, a wholesale subsidiary of Kumul Telikom Holdings and a State-owned commercial entity.
This project was one of the high priority projects included in the Framework Agreement on Development Cooperation between China and PNG signed on July 8, 2016. 
The project was financed by EXIM Bank and was completed in June 2020.
This project was a 5457km submarine fiber cable network project connecting 14 major cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang and Lae. 
At the same time, 14 submarine cable landing sites were built in 14 cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang, and Lae, to install submarine cable terminal equipment and network access equipment. 
Two data centers were also built in Port Moresby and Madang, used for supporting the operation of submarine cable services.
Firstly, the project has improved the bandwidth, reliability and stability of PNG’s domestic network.
It helped reduce the internet pricing by introducing competition mechanism;Secondly, the project connects PNG to China through Indonesia. 
The submarine cable has become an important international network channel for the South Pacific island countries;
Thirdly, the project drives the digital economy to help the country’s socio-economic progress and development.
Early in 2000, Fujian Province of China and Eastern Highlands Province of PNG signed a sister province agreement and listed Juncao and upland rice technology as the aiding technology to Eastern Highlands Province by Fujian Province. 
This project was carried out by the team of Prof. Lin Zhanxi from Fujian University of Agriculture and Forestry (FUAF). This project is now in its fourth phase.
In November 2018, during President Xi’s visit to PNG, leaders of the two countries witnessed the signing of the project, the first phase of which started in August 2019 and ended in August 2022. 
In February 2022, the two countries signed the second phase of the project, which will be implemented over a three-year period from September 2022 to August 2025.
The project has overcome the difficulties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, and has overfulfilled the tasks of the project in the fields of training, demonstration, production and extension.
In total, 27 technical training courses have been held, and a total of 2,921 people have been trained; Juncao mushroom, Juncao animal husbandry, and upland rice planting have been promoted to 17 districts in nine provinces, with a total of more than 10,000 farmers and 40,000 people benefiting from the project; and set the world record for highest output of pennisetum giganteum (Juncao grass), which was 8.53 tons per hectare.
Eastern Highlands Province has listed the Juncao and upland rice industries as the second and third major agricultural industries to be developed after the coffee industry.
The project has benefited many farmers in PNG and improved the agricultural skills level of the farmers. 
It became a model of Belt and Road Initiative cooperation between China and PNG, and played a very important role in deepening the development cooperation between the two countries and the sister-province relationship between Fujian and Eastern Highlands provinces.
The project team has provided local farmers with 1,226,700 Juncao mushroom tubes, and more than 1,725 farmers have participated in the cultivating Juncao mushroom.
The farmers mainly produce oyster mushroom and sell the harvested fresh mushroom to supermarkets, local market and supermarkets in Port Moresby.
Zaka Abori, a woman mushroom farmer, started growing mushroom in February 2020 with the help of Chinese experts and selling them through supermarkets, Facebook and social media.
The profit of growing mushroom are 20-30 times higher than her original cabbage cultivation, and the expansion of her earnings has allowed her to independently set up a tube production workshop, and her Juncao mushroom business is booming.
Farmers have planted more than 130 hectares of Juncao grass, and 1798 households have raised chickens, pigs, sheep, cows and other livestock using Juncao grass, significantly reducing their costs. 
In 7 districts including Goroka, Lufa, Hengenofi, Unggai Bena, Daulo and Kainantu, the project has promoted upland rice cultivation over 1215 hectares, and has supported more than 20 large upland rice producers and cooperatives, and promoted 7604 growers, which has brought great economic benefits to the local community.
The implementation of the project has promoted the development of Juncao, livestock and upland rice industries in PNG through technical training and demonstration, and opened up a new way for increasing employment and farmers’ income, as well as environmental protection, coping with climate change and sustainable development in PNG.

In Beijing this week, the tenth-year milestone of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be marked at a forum that highlights this often-debated model for economic development.
Large signs reading "The Third Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation" are displayed next to a bustling Beijing road. The previous forums convened in 2017 and 2019.  
This program, championed by China's President Xi Jinping, has provided funding for numerous global infrastructure projects, including ports, power plants, and railways. Nevertheless, the initiative has received criticism for its approach to providing loans to developing nations, which often results in them incurring substantial debt.
Wang Yiwei, the Director of the Institute of International Affairs at China's Renmin University, asserts that BRI encourages a collaborative approach to development with partner nations, providing them with paths to modernization.
Recent events, such as the construction of Southeast Asia's first high-speed railway in Indonesia, which commenced earlier this month, underscore the mixed reception BRI has encountered. While this 142-kilometer railway significantly reduces travel time between Jakarta and Bandung, it was marred by delays and escalating costs. Originally expected to launch in 2019, disputes over land acquisition, environmental concerns, and the COVID-19 pandemic postponed the project. Furthermore, the estimated cost of 66.7 trillion rupiah ($4.3 billion USD) ballooned to 113 trillion rupiah ($7.3 billion USD).
Similarly, the $5.9 billion Chinese-built railway linking Laos' capital, Vientiane, to the southern Chinese city of Kunming began operations in 2021, with over 60% of the investment being borrowed – an unusually high percentage for an infrastructure project, according to foreign experts. This has led to the initiative being perceived by some as a "debt trap."
Chinese contractors are also constructing a high-speed rail line from Bangkok to the Laos border, expected to be operational by 2028.
An example of a debt issue emerged earlier this year when a power plant in Jordan, once touted as a groundbreaking project to provide the country with a significant energy source, turned sour. Jordan now finds itself in an international legal battle and billions of dollars in debt to China for a plant that is no longer necessary for its energy needs, due to subsequent agreements made since the project's inception.
A "risk prevention" approach will be critical for the future of the Belt and Road Initiative, given the growing complications in a world marked by ongoing conflicts.
The Belt and Road Initiative Forum is scheduled to commence on October 18.

Algeria partners China for construction of 6,000km railway lines 
                                                      Railway line
                                                                                    -  
China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the "best guarantee of development", stressing that "our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km." The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
"China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner," said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
"The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth," he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
"As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities," said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
"This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone," echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

In a lecture room at the Electrical Engineering Department of the Papua New Guinea University of Technology in Lae, Morobe Province, participants of a three-week long ‘Renewable Energy’ Training stood in awe as the lecturer demonstrated how a smart electricity grid works.As the students gathered around the device, the lecturer explained how the grid could simultaneously utilise wind, hydro and solar power to produce clean energy.When one energy source turned off, the others would continue to produce power and ensure continued electricity supply.The lecturer asserted that such grids were key to expanding electricity access in Papua New Guinea, where only 20 per cent of the population currently enjoys regular access to electricity.The training was held under the renewable energy component of the European Union-funded “Support to Rural Entrepreneurship, Investment and Trade” (STREIT) programme, which aims to expand electricity access in the rural areas of East and West Sepik Provinces through renewable energy solutions.As one of the implementing agencies of the programme, UNDP has installed solar photovoltaic systems to schools and health facilities in six sites in the targeted provinces.Over 30 seasoned electricians, engineers, PNG Power employees, and teachers from East and West Sepik Provinces attended the training in Lae to gain the necessary skills to maintain these systems and to become solar energy experts in their respective communities.This marked the third and final training for the participants since 2021. Mr. Wilson Lalu, an electrician with over 40 years of experience, says that the training gave him a new perspective on renewable energy.Mr. Wilson currently works on one of project sites of the STREIT Programme in Nagam, East Sepik Province.Under UNDP’s leadership, the project has installed 176 solar panels and connected them to a battery system that provides continuous power to all dormitories, classrooms and staff houses in a local school.“My involvement at Nagam was during the commissioning of the system. Being an electrician, I had never worked on solar systems like that before. The training has given me a new perspective on the industry,” Mr Lalu said.Computer science teacher and licenced electrician from Vanimo Secondary School Bobby Tagen, also participated in the training. In 2023, UNDP installed a solar photovoltaic system on the school grounds and connected it to the main grid operated by PNG Power.The initiative ensured reliable electricity access to the school’s over 800 students.“The system has been working perfectly since it was installed in 2023. This training taught me about how such systems can be kept running for a longer period of time. This knowledge will help me maintain the system in our school and has motivated me to continue promoting the use of solar power in my community,” Mr. Tagen said.The training was facilitated by the University of Technology’s Sustainable Energy Research Institute (SERI).The Director of SERI, Professor Dapsy Olatona, hopes the training will yield positive results for the communities of the participants.“Our aim is that the participants will return to their villages and take part in installing renewable energy systems, particularly solar systems, in a manner that SERI has taught them.”The Government of Papua New Guinea has set a target of connecting 70 per cent of Papua New Guinea’s population to renewable electricity by 2030. By 2050, the Government hopes to have reached universal electricity access throughout the country.UNDP hopes to contribute to this aim through its various initiatives in the country.In addition to its activities under the STREIT programme, UNDP is currently constructing a one-megawatt solar farm in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.The construction is funded by the Government of Japan and the engineers working on the project will undergo the same training at the PNG University of Technology in Lae.“UNDP is committed to supporting the Government in increasing access to affordable, reliable and sustainable energy throughout Papua New Guinea.Without enhancing access to clean energy, we cannot succeed in our efforts to eradicate poverty, reduce inequalities and enhance environmental sustainability in Papua New Guinea,” stated UNDP Resident Representative, Mr. Nicholas Booth, after the training.“The sustainable future of our planet depends on countries making a successful transition onto greener and cleaner forms of energy.The European Union is proud to finance and support this initiative that will enable Papua New Guinea to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and expand electricity access to some of the most vulnerable communities in the country,” added the European Union Ambassador to Papua New Guinea, H.E. Jacques Fradin.

Puma Energy Papua New Guinea has officially commissioned a solar project at its Napanapa Refinery, marking a milestone for the company’s solarisation journey, not only in PNG but also globally.The project, which took four months to build, saw the installation of 684 solar panels at the Napa Napa Refinery, outside Port Moresby.This new setup can deliver 300KW of solar power, producing 485.5 MWh of energy per year, which will help modernise and reduce the facility’s CO2 emissions.The development is a key part of Puma Energy’s sustainability strategy to reduce its operational GHG emissions.The company has set a sustainability target to reduce its global operational (Scope 1 and 2) emissions by 15 per cent by the end of 2025 and by 35 per cent by the end of 2032.The solar project at Napa Napa refinery complements Puma Energy’s global program to connect its Puma branded retail stations and other sites to solar energy.
The company has already connected more than 250 Puma branded retail stations to solar energy, and is planning to connect 300 by the end of 2023.In total, the company has now installed 8875 MW of solar energy generation capacity across its operations. Alongside the solar capacity Puma Energy has already installed across its network, this project will allow Puma to apply the expertise gained through this installation to offer similar renewable solutions to our commercial customers in Papua New Guinea.This will mean they can benefit from reduced energy costs, lower greenhouse gas emissions and a reliable supply of energy.Papua New Guinea company chairman and managing director, Hulala Tokome said: “We are proud that Puma Energy PNG has launched the company’s biggest solar project in the region. It highlights our firm long-term commitment to operating sustainably and responsibly in the country.”“Papua New Guinea’s enhanced nationally determined contribution sets out ambitious plans to reduce its carbon emissions by half by 2030 and be entirely carbon neutral by 2050. This project fully supports these goals and, by helping our customers to install similar renewable energy solutions, Puma Energy can play a major role in helping the country meet these environmental commitments and promote energy security.“Our ambition is to fulfil our purpose of energising communities while supporting the energy transition and reducing our environmental impact.”

BY FRANCO NEBASThe Morobe Provincial Government has signed an agreement with a Dubai-based company to build a solar power in the province.Morobe Governor Luther Wenge announced this when signing a memorandum of agreement with Dubai-based AstralENERGY.
Mr Wenge said power outages was a legacy issue to the people of Lae and Morobe for years.He said the issue was never being addressed by the past successive governments up until today.“Morobe is now looking towards Dubai to supply and installed two solar power plants possibly in Lae and Huon Gulf districts,” he said.
He said AstralENERGY has been engaged under the private investment programs arranged by the Morobe Provincial Government.To facilitate the finance and construction of the Energy Impact Projects or programs, such as with solar, hydro and geothermal power plants, are one of the key policies for this government,” he said.The solar power plants will be built and installed at two different locations.
“One will be located at Labu supplying power to the main industrial centres including the wharf and market areas while the other one to be built behind Martin Luther Seminary supplying Malahang Industrial centre and surrounding areas,”he said.The total capacity which to be generated shall be of 100 megawatt that capable to supply power to the city.Mr Wenge said the total cost of the project is K250 million and will be 50 per cent counter-funding between the AstralENERGY and Government of PNG through the Private Investment Program. The project will generate huge income for the province as the power will be sold at half price charged by PNG Power Limited.The company engaged by MPG as a partner in this economical viable project is AstralENERGY Project Management Services in PNG.It is a Dubai-based company but since having joint venture partners with provinces and government of PNG in such magnitude projects in its specialities, the company has then incorporated under the Investment Promotion Authority and in the process of establishing.AstralENERGY chief executive officer Richard Peter said the project is expected to commence before the end of June 2023.

The US government, through the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and Santos bring electricity to a rural community in Southern Highlands Province.In partnership with the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority, Santos through the Santos funded Oil Search Foundation (OSF) and USAID launched the Pimaga Rural Hospital Solar Electrification Project on March 28, at Pimaga, in Nipa Kutubu district, Southern Highlands Province.The mini grid installed through the project will now serve not only hundreds of patients seen at the clinic but will also provide power to the dozen or more clinic staff and their families who live on the compound.
Enhanced electrical capacity at the clinic will keep patients more comfortable, as well as allowing clinicians to carry out medical treatments more reliably and safely.Santos country chair PNG, Leon Buskens said the use of renewable energy such as solar demonstrates Santos’ Vision 2040 to be a leading global provider of clean fuels and investing in carbon reduction initiatives.“This collaboration with USAID and the Southern Highlands Provincial Health Authority (SHPHA) to bring electricity through the solar mini grid project will go a long way in providing a much-needed source of cheap, economically viable, and sustainable form of energy source,” Mr Buskens said.
Santos Foundation’s chief programs officer, Jean Martin said the Foundation is committed to working with their partners like SHPHA and the district development authority to strengthen the systems that enhance service delivery.“Reliable clean energy will improve service delivery at Pimaga Rural Hospital, and we are pleased to have been able to partner with USAID PEP to undertake this piece of work,” she said.The mini-grid project was supported through USAID’s Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership (USAID-PEP) Activity, a five-year project in partnership with the Government of PNG that will contribute to the goal of connecting 70 per cent of PNG’s population to electricity by 2030.

The National Energy Authority has chosen solar energy infrastructure, including roof-tops and solar farms, as the best option for New Ireland Province’s electricity needs.NEA as part of its National Electricity Roll Out Plan (NEROP) has visited New Ireland Province where it held talks with the provincial management team on how both team will work to improve electricity supply to the province.NEA managing director, Ronald Meketa said the challenges for NIP and provinces with many isolated islands is the difficulty of running transmission lines from the main grid across the seas.
He said the best option for such inaccessible islands is for solar energy infrastructure including roof-tops and solar farms but that does not rule out the option of underwater transmission lines.“As long as the stakeholder, especially provincial governments are willing, NEA can assist in making that a reality, and reaffirms the NEA’s position,” he said.One of the options that was left open for discussion was whether NIP could access the excess power produced by Newscrest Lihir’s geothermal power installation that is used for its operation.
PNG has some of the most rugged and difficult terrains in the world, hundreds of its island villages are as isolated as compared to the remote villages in the highlands.Mr Meketa said this was primarily the reason why the government in 2017 adopted the National Energy Policy and is presently driving the electricity agenda through the NEA to implement the NEROP.“This year the NEC approved the Special Steering Committee for NEROP comprising of secretaries of the DNPM, Treasury and PNG Power Ltd with NEA taking the leading role,” he said.
“The NEA is primarily the state regulator of the electricity supply services and downstream gas industry and is also the policy maker of renewables in PNG.”However, Mr Meketa said, NEA is also filling the gap regarding the implementation aspects of driving projects by providing stakeholders, especially provincial governments with technical support, advisory roles in differing policies, and legal advice, and talking with project partners including multi-donor agencies to partner in power generation, transmission, power purchase agreements in areas where PPL cannot provide reliable grid and power, among others.NEA is now working with the government to begin its first pilot project for islands in PNG to provide rooftop and standalone solar panels starting with NIP.

The Mineral Resources Authority will save about 60 per cent of its annual energy bills averaging about K650,000 with the launching of its new photo-voltaic (PV) solar power system.The PV solar power system was launched yesterday at the Mining Haus by chairman of the MRA board, Benny Kimisive and officer-in-charge (OIC) Nathan Mosusu.The grid-tie system installed on the roof-top of the Mining Haus has a capacity of 162 kilowatts.
It will be used as a power source, which will operate concurrently with the PNG Power Limited (PPL) grid to supply the building’s power demand of about 250 kW.The system is designed to operate at optimum with the balance of the building’s power demand to be supplied by the PPL utility grid.This will have a great effect on the final electricity bills.
The project has been installed in partnership with PPL.It is part of PPL’s project called the “roof-top solar photovoltaic pilot project”.Mr Mosusu, while officiating at the event, said the project is a demonstration of MRA’s commitment towards achieving the government’s national strategic development plan of generating 25 per cent of electricity from renewable resources by 2030.
He said they have been relying on fossil fuel for electricity and that this was the beginning of a paradigm shift towards doing things smarter using greener technology, and solar energy is a step in the right direction.“In 2018 alone, PNG imported about 42,000 barrels of fossil fuel oil and MRA’s new power source would contribute to the reduction in these statistics,” Mr Mosusu said.“The OIC said the biggest share of the 42, 000 barrels of oil, would no doubt, be attributed to the power requirements of the mining industry.“As the regulator, we at MRA must set the standards in reducing our carbon footprint, so that the industry can hopefully follow suit.”Board chairman, Mr Kimisive, said the board had been supportive of this project since its inception, adding that this would greatly reduce MRA’s power cost.He said there were more of such projects in the pipeline and the board would continue to support MRA’s management in achieving these projects.PNG Power Limited CEO Obed Batia said in a statement that the initiative of roof-top solar PV project is part of the organisation’s Pacific Renewable Energy Advisory Project, which is supported by the International Finance Corporation (IFC).He said under this project, 10 organisations were participating, including MRA, adding that MRA was the first participant to have successfully installed the system.

PNG Power Limited and the Milne Bay Provincial Government have entered into a historic partnership which sees the provincial authority funding a 0.8 Megawatts hybrid solar farm for its Alotau township.
Milne Bay Governor, Gordon Wesley said currently Alotau only has a load of 1.8 MW on average and up to 3 MW during peak hours.
“These new developments include a planned housing estate at Gehua, a waterfront super mall, expansion of the Hagita and Saint Barnabas Nursing College and an industrial hub at Ahioma.
We will need more power here on and I am pleased to partner with PNG Power, to give me that additional reliable and stable power supply for my province in the months to come,’ he said.
Mr Wesley also highlighted the efforts by the Provincial Administration on Climate Change and Green Energy, of which this Solar PV project does justification to this drive.
PNG Power chief executive officer,Obed Batia commended the Alotau Provincial Government, through the Governor, for the exemplary leadership and making MBPG the first province to fund a renewable energy generation facility purely to support the development of the province without pushing for any commercial returns.
“Under this arrangement, a hybrid solar farm will be built in the province to support the current power generation from the Alotau Power Station.
Once completed, Alotau town will have two power generation sources,” he said.
The Solar PV system will run to support the diesel during the day, battery for a couple of hours during the evening and then during off-peak hours at night, while PPL can use one or two of its generating units to keep the lights on till day break.
Mr Batia said the partnership is highly valued as there is no commercial arrangement between the parties, rather, an effort to make sure there is stable, reliable power supply to the growing demand of the province.
The project will take six (6) months from commencement to the test and commissioning of the Alotau Solar Power Project.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Papua New Guinea together with the National Government and the Autonomous Bougainville Government have launched US$4.4 million (K15.5 million) Bougainville Micro Solar Farms Project in the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.The project supports the provision of renewable and reliable energy for a more sustainable and climate resilient future for the people of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville.This project is part of the wider US$36 million (K126 million) “Enhancing Green Transformation in the Pacific towards Net-Zero Emissions and Climate-Resilient Development for Peace” project that the Government of Japan is funding to support four Pacific Island nations.
The “Green Transformation” initiatives will reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, drive sustainable economic growth and help them cope with the impacts of climate change.The four Pacific countries benefiting from this project are PNG, Samoa, Timor Leste, and Vanuatu.The project will leverage the expertise of UNDP’s Climate Promise portfolio to support each country to transition toward net zero and climate resilient pathways, in line with their commitments enshrined in the Paris Agreement, and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
Funded by the Government of Japan, the Bougainville Micro Solar Farms Project is designed to support the development of renewable energy options in Bougainville and reduction on reliance on diesel as the main form of energy in the region.The project will support the construction and commissioning of three micro solar farms in the north, central, and south regions of Bougainville with a total capacity of 1 megawatt (MW).It will also provide independent and neutral support to the two governments in the implementation of the post referendum process.
The Ambassador of Japan to PNG, Nobuyuki Watanabe said it was an opportune time to help support the green transformation in the Pacific and in particular PNG that relies heavily on fossil fuels to power much of its electricity generation.

Senegal and the French group Meridiam, which specialises in the financing and development of infrastructure, announced on Monday that they had signed a contract for the acquisition and management of electric buses in Dakar.
the initiative aims at reducing congestion in this West African metropolis.
The BRT (bus rapid transfer) project, on which work is underway, aims to provide Dakar with electric rapid buses from 2023 onwards, running on exclusive lanes between the suburbs and the city centre, over a distance of more than 18 km, a stretch where traffic is slowed down because of traffic jams.
The investment for the electric buses amounts to 127 billion FCFA (193.6 million euros), according to the Senegalese authorities. The total cost of the BRT project is more than 300 billion FCFA (€450 million) financed by donors such as the World Bank.
Senegal signed the contract with Meridiam and a consortium made up of the French state-owned companies SNCF and RATP, the French transport operator Kéolis and Fonsis, a Senegalese investment fund, said on Monday a statement from the Executive Council for Urban Transport in Dakar (Cetud), a body attached to the Senegalese Transport Ministry.
The 15-year concession contract covers "the acquisition, operation and maintenance of rolling stock and BRT systems". Meridiam announced "the provision of a fleet of 100% electric buses, with batteries, including an initial fleet of 121", in a separate press release. This is a concrete project in favour of energy transition that offers a solution adapted to the challenge of climate change, but also an effective alternative to the existing diesel bus network", it said.
The BRT project also includes the construction of workshops and depots, more than 80 km of roads and pavements to be developed or rehabilitated along the axes served, including intersections, bus stops and terminals. It complements the regional express train (TER) running between Dakar and its suburbs, the first section of which was inaugurated in December.
The two transport systems, BRT and TER, which complement each other with feeder lines, aim to relieve congestion in Dakar, where 0.3% of Senegal's 17 million people live and almost all of the country's economic activities are concentrated. Traffic jams officially cost the city 152 million euros per year.

Angola and DRC announce joint project to rehabilitate railway line
                                                       Railway in Democratic Republic of Congo 
                                                                                    -  
Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) have announced a joint project to rehabilitate the railway line linking the Congolese mining regions to the Atlantic Ocean.
Earlier this week, Luanda and Kinshasa granted a group of investors a 30-year concession to operate the line linking the Angolan port of Lobito to Kolwezi, in the heart of the DRC's mineral-producing region.
The 1,700 km railway line was built 100 years ago by British investors.
The $555 million project, partly finance by the US, is expected to develop exports of copper ore and other products, boost regional trade and strengthen Angola's ties with Western countries.
The DRC is the world's leading producer of cobalt and Africa's leading producer of copper, two minerals used in the manufacture of solar panels and electric cars.
According to the Angolan operator, Vecturis, work should start within the next three months.
The consortium, which includes commodities trader Trafigura and Portuguese construction company Mota-Engil, hopes to reduce the journey time between the DRC and Lobito to less than 36 hours, with at least six trains a day over the next five years.

					Papua New Guinea's 'trupla' leading Daily Newspaper Since 1969.The Post-Courier is proud of its record as the voice of PNG. We were there when the nation took its first bold steps towards independence. Since that time, we have fearlessly recorded the nation's progress.

Papua New Guinea will not be short of energy, particularly sustainable, renewable and cleaner energy forms.Anyone who has spent some number of years studying science, physics or engineering will know that.Yet, it is bewilders the majority of educated people in PNG why we continue to have power outages in the main centres like Port Moresby or Lae and other provincial capitals of PNG.
Why?Why are the abundant energy forms in PNG not harnessed to give us the power we need 24/7 and 365 days of the year?Answer: The decision makers, the Ministers and MPs and those in charge of the authorities and state-owned enterprises which deal with energy have not inked a proper plan to ensure that sustainable and reliable energy must be harnessed to supply all the major centres in the country and making diesel power redundant.
PNG will turn 50 years in 2025, and yet the power outages continue, not to mention water issues, and surprisingly the nation’s capital is one centre that falls victim to these issues.In Monday’s edition of your Nambawan Paper, it was reported that the power blackouts in Port Moresby may be a thing of the past as the Edevu Hydropower Project in Hiri-Koiari district in Central Province will soon supply the city with 50MW of power.The government partnered with PNG Hydro Develop Ltd with a support of K120 million. The firm is spending K650 million to develop the project.
That is wonderful news for Port Moresby and Central Province, but what about the many other urban centres of PNG which still depend on diesel fuel to provide power?Is there any mega plan to develop hydropower projects or solar farms in those centres so they can provide sustainable and cleaner forms of energy?The future though is not so gloom when we see certain MPs taking the lead to build their own power plants to ensure their district centres and headquarters have reliable power.Bulolo is a case in point. They are working on their Bayune underground power station.Local MP Sam Basil Jr in a March 1 report said “we say no to power blackouts in our district”.Such MPs must be supported by the government and all the state authorities to complete their projects. It is the way forward.Other MPs and Governors too must learn from such examples and start building their own power generation stations.They cannot just sit back and come complain in Parliament about power outages.They must be proactive and ask the government to assist.The government on the other hand must have its mega plan to support districts and provinces to build their own power stations to generate sustainable and cleaner forms of energy.On top of that, the use of diesel generators must be made redundant.That is the way forward.

HydroBox Kenya, a hydroelectric power plant, stands as a testament to the vision of Kenyan entrepreneur John Magiro, the founder of Magiro Hydro Electricity, in partnership with Belgian equity investment company, HydroBox. 
With a total project cost of approximately Ksh 105.7 million (equivalent to $740,897.50 USD), the initiative received crucial technical and financial backing from prominent entities including the National Environment Trust Fund (NETFUND), the World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF), the Energy and Petroleum Regulatory Authority (EPRA), and Belgium's FINEXPO.
Located in Murang'a County, the power plant now serves over 2,000 households, significantly contributing to the Kenyan government's rural electrification program. In 2021, a staggering 600 million Africans, comprising 43 percent of the continent's population, lacked access to electricity, with 590 million residing in sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting the urgent need for reliable power sources.
A key issue plaguing the region is frequent power outages, underscoring the importance of embracing renewable energy options like solar and hydro. Despite the potential, these sources remain underutilized.
HydroBox distinguishes itself as the sole hydroelectric power plant in Kenya's central region. It harnesses the energy of diverted water from a nearby river to spin turbines that generate electricity. The process initiates with the creation of a small reservoir, where water is channeled into a canal and subsequently directed through a pipeline to the turbine. This rotational motion drives an alternator that produces power, with the entirety of the water returning unaltered to the river, preserving environmental integrity.
Impressively, the plant has the capacity to generate up to 750 kilowatts of power, which is then distributed to an array of consumers, including households, educational institutions, and businesses. In case of drought or low river levels, the incorporation of solar panels ensures uninterrupted power supply.
John Magiro emphasizes that the water remains uncontaminated throughout the process, with 100 percent of it being released back into the river downstream.
Local residents like Grace Wairimu benefit greatly from this hydroelectric energy source, using it for various daily needs such as television viewing and phone charging.
Steve Maina, the CEO of the nearby Kiriti Tea Factory, has witnessed a marked improvement in production quality and consistency since adopting hydropower. Previously, power interruptions would compromise tea leaf quality and market prices, but with the stable supply, the factory can ensure consistent quality and maintain its reputation.
Azarius Karanja, of sustainability consulting firm Niko Green, underscores that smaller hydroelectric systems like HydroBox have limited negative environmental impacts, as they divert water for only a short distance before returning it to the river. The social and economic benefits, particularly in underserved, off-grid communities, often outweigh any potential drawbacks, making these systems a compelling model for energy access and development.
John Magiro provides insight into the plant's operation, detailing the water diversion process, which leads to the generation of 750 kilowatts of power supplied to various customers, including tea factories, businesses, schools, and local residents.
In summary, HydroBox Kenya, led by the visionary John Magiro, has emerged as a beacon of sustainable energy in the heart of Kenya. Through innovative water diversion and hydropower generation, it not only improves the lives of local residents but also aids businesses and schools while minimizing environmental impacts. It stands as a model for regional energy development and electrification initiatives.

                                                      A worker blows leaves at the main entrance of the Komati Power Station in Middelburg, South Africa, Monday, June 19, 2023. 
                                                                                    -  
The industrial landscape of the northeastern province of Mpumalanga, an area known as South Africa's coal belt will soon be transformed.
The Komati power plant, once a busy coal plant that is now earmarked to be repurposed as a wind and solar power plant that will have batteries to store the energy the clean power generates, looks deserted with only security guards and cleaners on site.
Unlike other power stations in Mpumalanga where smoke bellows from the unit chimneys with coal trucks entering and leaving the plants, only one entrance at the Komati plant, which was first opened for business in 1961, is functional.
The country's worst blackouts have put the spotlight on the government's controversial energy transition strategy.
“These arguments about decommissioning power plants have come up, and while climate change is a significant issue and we do need to transition to lower carbon sources of electricity, we need to consider the need for an increase in electricity in general in South Africa," Julia Taylor, a researcher on Climate Change and Inequality at the University of the Witwatersrand said.
"So we need to continue to build out renewable energy but not start switching anything off until we have enough electricity to provide for basic needs in the country.”
The Komati plant's repurposing is a pilot project that will hopefully show the way for South Africa and the rest of the developing world’s transition to clean energy away from dirty fossil fuels.
The World Bank has provided a loan of $490 million for the plant’s repurposing.
The money is supposed to include the retraining of former plant employees, but it was unclear this week how much of this part of the project had already started.
The work related to repurposing the plant is yet to gather steam, with estimations that this may take up to five years.
In November last year, the last generation unit at the coal-fired power station which was generating about 125 megawatts of power was shut down.
Controversial funding modelThis week, the power utility Eskom invited bids for the implementation of a socio-economic plan to mitigate the effects of the plant’s closure, including the economic impact on the province of Mpumalanga and surrounding communities where the plant is located.
When developing countries are asked to prioritize green projects out of environmental concerns, various deals are proposed. The Just Energy Transition Partnership (JetP) financing model has raised questions. 
While $490 million is a large sum by any measure, a Researcher highlights that a large portion of this money is in the form of loans.
“There are a few questions that have been raised around the funding model associated with the JetP", she says.
"And the first is, particularly from South African perspective, is that only 4% of the current amount that's promised is grants. So it's actually mostly loans and guarantees. And obviously, we're a country in a significant amount of debt.”
South Africa's president is attending a summit on climate and debt in Paris. Top on the agenda are changes needed in the way multilateral lenders grant money to developing countries which are often hardest hit by the climate crisis. The bodies have been criticized for not factoring this crisis in their decisions.
Lives soon turned upside down?The closest residential area near the Komati power plant is a small suburb, also called Komati, and most people here work at coal mines around the province.
They used to be owned by the power utility Eskom during the apartheid era and were provided for white managers of the power plant. They were sold off to individuals after 1994, mostly high-earning workers at coal mines around the province.
The locals say most of the houses are now being rented out to contractors for the coal mines and trucking companies in the region. Groups of men were waiting around Komati, hoping to be picked up by contractors in trucks who provide them temporary jobs as gardeners or cleaners in nearby settlements. 
There is only one primary school and one shopping mall in Komati and everyone here depends on coal jobs to make ends meet.

                                                                                    -  
A South African town was forced to shut down part of its power-generating solar panels to comply with national grid's Eskom schedule of daily blackouts.
For the local energy distributor, wasting precious energy will have consequences for businesses.
3. SOUNDBITE 1 - Gugu Mokoena, General Manager of private electricity distributor, Rural Free State (female, English, 33 sec):
"The court refusing us or Eskom refusing us to continue with this. It means load shedding, and with load shedding, it means that the businesses won't have, some of them will have to consider closing shop because then they will be reliant on diesel which is expensive. And that will mean, that would mean job losses for the community of Mafube", admits Gugu Mokoena, General Manager of private electricity distributor, Rural Free State.
Nationwide power cuts in South Africa can last up to 12 hours a day.Many businesses cannot afford the fuel to keep generators running for hours on end.
"We have lost chickens, it was cycle one, it was in January. I lost I think about five, not exactly, but it's plus or minus 5000 chickens, in both three houses. In a house it was a high mortality in house one, high mortality in house two, high mortality in house three due to load shedding" said Gary Mbundire , Manager at a chicken farm in Frankfort.
Local residents and businesses started using locally produced energy from the solar power plant last February in a bid to mitigate the impact of nationwide blackouts imposed by Eskom.
"If they are not going to allow us to use the solar farm or to use our own electricity, we don't have any choice, we will have to take the law into our own hands and it's a matter of survival. We cannot, we cannot allow Eskom and NERSA (National Energy Regulator of South Africa, Ed.) to prevent us from solving the problem that was created by Eskom. They can't produce any electricity and we are not allowed to use the electricity that we produce. It doesn't make sense", threatened local farmer Hans Pretorius. 
South Africa's leading opposition party, the Democratic Alliance, accused Eskom of acting "like a village bully" in this case, preferring to protect its monopoly to embracing additional generation capacity.
                                                                                    01:00

South Africa: Masakhane township residents worried about transition from coal to green energy
                                                      Clean energy
                                                                                    -  
Residents living near one of South Africa's largest coal-fired power stations fear their livelihoods will be at risk if the power station is closed or repurposed as part of South Africa's transition from coal to cleaner sources of electricity like solar and wind.
As one of the world's biggest polluters due to its heavy reliance on coal to produce electricity, South Africa's plans to phase out its coal-fired power station in favour of green energy.
It recently secured at least $8.5 billion in funding to repurpose the coal-fired power plants to renewable energy sites producing solar and wind power.
The plan has been welcomed and is being funded by western countries including Germany, U.S and the UK.
It was widely endorsed at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt where the country signed agreements for some parts of the loan funding.
The country's first power station to be decommissioned, Komati Power Station in Mpumalanga, is targeted for repurposing for solar and wind power generation.
Located about 2km from the Duvha Power Station, Masakhane township is home to thousands of residents, with many having migrated from various parts of the country to settle closer to the power station in search of economic opportunities.
The community is also located on the backdrop of Mooifontein and Wolvekrans open-cast collieries, which supply tons of coal to the power station.
The primary sources of income for community members are directly and indirectly linked to coal mining and the 3600 megawatts power station, ranging from transportation and food industries to contract work inside the power station. They continue to use coal on a daily basis for cooking and heating.
Selby Mahlalela moved from his Nelspruit home in the same province of Mpumalanga to Masakhane in 2006, and has been doing various jobs as contract worker for the power utility Eskom since then, doing maintenance-related jobs.
"It is the one place that the majority of people from here rely on for job opportunities, despite them not being permanent workers. This happens a lot especially when there are shutdowns or maintenance work. The people get to have some," said Mahlalela.
But the transition remains a contentious issue, even within President Cyril Ramaphosa's cabinet.
This week, energy minister Gwede Mantashe told lawmakers that the transition to cleaner energy should not happen at the cost of people's livelihoods and the country's energy security.
"I am one of the people who say, we can have a transition. But that coal is not about just numbers, it is about human beings. It is (about) ten towns in Mpumalanga," said Mantashe.
Silindile Kheswa is among those who have benefited from short-term contract work and skills development by working at the power station, and fears the transition may spell the worst for those not able to get jobs in renewable energy projects.
"Some of our brothers are involved in the trucking of coal, transporting it to various power stations. So if you are saying no more coal, that means we can't put food on the table," said Kheswa.
The Duvha power station is one of the 15 coal fired powered power stations operated by the power utility Eskom. and has faced many breakdown recently, contributing to the country's rolling power blackouts.
