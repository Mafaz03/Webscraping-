Ex- Assembly member in court for not constructing funded road project
Accra, Feb. 27, GNA- Nii Armah Ashitey a former Assembly member, who was allegedly given GHC500,000 by a foundation to construct road and drainage but failed has appeared before an Accra Circuit Court.
Ashitey. a former assembly member for Adobetor electoral area in La Dadekotpon Municipality, has been charged with defrauding by false pretences, using public office for profit, money laundering.
The 63-year-old former assembly member has pleaded not guilty to the various charges.
Ashiety is said to have told the Police that he used the money for “mobilization of the project” but could not provide documents and receipts to that effect.
The court presided over by Mr Isaac Addo has admitted Ashitey to bail in the sum of GHC500,000 with two sureties.
Prosecution led by Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Seth Frimpong said the complainants, Maxwell Ahugah and Mrs Naomi Vogel were manager and director, respectively of Robert Vogel Memorial Foundation.
ASP Frimpong said the accused person was a resident of La Wireless.
Prosecution said somewhere in the month of May 2018, Robert Vogel Foundation Memorial, a non-profit organization, engaged in philanthropic activities within the Community, decided to construct a road and drainage as part of their community development at Adobetor electoral area.
According to prosecution, the construction of the projects took place during Ashitey’s tenure as an assembly member of La Dadekotopon Municipal Assembly.
The prosecutor said Ashitey was approached by the Director and Manager of the Robert Vogel Memorial Foundation about their desire to construct a particular road with its attached drainage.
Prosecution said the accused person took advantage of the gesture and presented to the complainants, Bill of Quantities on a number of roads and drains that the assembly had earmarked to construct.
The court heard that Ashitey deceived the Director Mrs Naomi Vogel of the said Foundation to transfer GHC500,000 into his personal account with La Community Bank which he presented as the Municipal Assembly ‘s account.
Again, prosecution said the accused person “deceived the foundation manager and director into believing that the construction of the selected road and drains at Adobetor area had been done with the funds from the Foundation.
Prosecution said the accused person, however, failed to undertake the construction which he claimed he had the capacity to undertake.
The prosecutor said on April 11, 2023, Ashitey was arrested and during interrogation, he told the Police that he “used all the GHC500,000 to do mobilization of the project”.
Prosecution said during investigations, the accused person was given the opportunity to furnish the Police with receipts or documents to know how the funds were disbursed for the “mobilization but he could not provide any document or receipts.”
ASP Frimpong said the Police visited the area where the construction should have been done and it was observed that the road had not been constructed and no drainage was done.
“Investigations revealed that accused person simply made this representation which he knew were false to obtain the consent of the manager and the director of the foundation to part with the GHC500,000 and he has since misappropriated the said amount with no effort or ability to construct the road,” prosecution said.
The prosecutor said it was also established that by the accused person’s status as someone who held office as elected assembly member for Adobetor electoral area, he was a public officer.

Agric Minister cuts sod for construction of farm infrastructure projects  
Accra, Feb 20, GNA — Dr. Bryan Acheampong, Minister of Food and Agriculture, has cut the sod for the construction of farm infrastructure for smallholder farmers in Kwasi Fante, Afram Plains South District, Eastern Region. 
The project, which is under the Emergency Support to Rural Livelihoods and Food Systems exposed to COVID-19 (ESRF), includes the construction of farm tracks (roads), water harvesting schemes, drying platforms, and boreholes.  
It aims to enhance the lives of smallholder farmers by providing better access to markets, addressing water scarcity, increasing crop yields, and improving post-harvest management.  
It is supported by the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD). 
Speaking at the sod-cutting ceremony over the weekend, Dr Acheampong said building robust agriculture infrastructure was critical to improving farm yields and achieving food security for the country. 
In that regard, he said, the government was embarking on a massive infrastructure development in the agriculture sector, disclosing that, about 100-hectare water harvesting schemes would be constructed for smallholder farmers in Tordzinu, South Tongu District, and Klenormadi, Ketu District, in the Volta Region.  
Additionally, he said, 16 commodity drying platforms would be built, and 29.5 kilometres of farm tracks would be constructed in various regions. 
“Furthermore, 20 boreholes will be installed in the North-East Gonja, Nanton, Atebubu, Bono East, Northern, and Savannah regions,” he added. 
Dr Acheampong said the projects, when completed, would impact smallholder farmers and beneficiary communities, stating that they would be better equipped to face challenges posed by climate change.  
The Minister urged contractors undertaking the projects to adhere to the highest construction standards and avoid shoddy work to ensure that the projects lasted a lifetime 
He thanked IFAD for its assistance in making the projects feasible and called for collective action to transform the agricultural sector and contribute to Ghana’s economic growth. 
Dr Hayford Baah-Adade, the Programme Coordinator for ESRF, said that the projects would support smallholder farmers and beneficiary communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.  
He said that the initiative aimed to achieve three key goals: protect against hunger and build resilient livelihoods; safeguard rural marketing linkages and food security; and project management, monitoring, and evaluation. 
He assured the Minister of delivering quality work, indicating that the contractors had been selected based on their expertise and successful track records in executing such infrastructure projects.  
Dr. Baah-Adade urged supervising agencies, such as the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), the Department of Feeder Roads (DFR), and the Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA), to be accountable for providing effective supervision and monitoring project progress to ensure quality and timely delivery of projects.

PIAC begins oil-funded project inspections for 2024  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Accra, Jan 21, GNA – The Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) has begun the year with the inspection of public infrastructure projects funded with petroleum revenues. 
The committee undertook a simultaneous inspection in the Greater Accra and Central Regions based on information provided by the Ministry of Finance on projects and the accompanying disbursements of petroleum revenues through the Annual Budget Funding Amount (ABFA). 
The exercise was in line with PIAC’s mandate of conducting independent assessment of the management and use of petroleum revenues to ensure maximum impact. 
A PIAC team in Accra was led by the Chair, Emerita Professor Elizabeth Ardayfio-Schandorf and by officials of the Department of Urban Roads of the Ministry of Roads and Highways, and the Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly in some project sites at Teshie and Spintex.  
They were the rehabilitation of selected roads in Teshie Camp, Southern Command and Mats (now Ghana Military Academy), the Construction of the 7.5-kilometre Teshie Link.  Teshie Link, and the Construction of a Flyover over the Tema Motorway from the Flowerpot roundabout.  
These three (3) projects, located in the Ledzokuku Municipality are at different stages of progress and received funds from the ABFA between 2019 and 2022.  
The Team toured the rehabilitated roads, a car park, and a parade ground within the Southern Command in Teshie.  
Information available to PIAC showed that the contract for this project was awarded on July 13, 2020 and was supposed to have been completed within 24 months.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project was 24% physically complete. Out of the total contract sum of GH¢145.82 million, petroleum revenue of GH¢7.39 million, representing 5.07 per cent, was disbursed to the project in 2022.  
The second project inspected by the team was the construction of the 7.5-kilometre Teshie Link.  
It involved the construction of a new road and drainage structures with earthworks and asphaltic concrete surfacing.  
Awarded on 18th October 2019, the project had an original contract duration of 18 months.  
Out of the original contract sum of GH¢87.88 million petroleum revenue of GH¢29.73 million, representing 33.84 per cent was disbursed to the project from 2019 to 2021.  
The PIAC Team was informed that the Teshie Link Road is a dual carriageway that commences in the South on the Accra-Tema coastal road, through the LEKMA Hospital, and terminates on the Spintex Road.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, 95% of all drainage works had been completed, and asphaltic binder and wearing course laid on the road.  
The team was informed that the contractor had suspended work due to non-payment of funds. 
Outstanding works include the installation of traffic signals and road markings to show a controlled intersection.  
The absence of these had resulted in several vehicle crashes in the area.  
The third project was the construction of a flyover over the Tema Motorway, from the Flowerpot roundabout.  
Out of the revised contract sum of GH¢284,665,639.27, a total of GH¢141,093,766.84 representing 49.56 per cent, was disbursed from the ABFA in 2022.  
The project is located at the Flowerpot Roundabout, Spintex and East Legon, and involves creating access from the Motorway to the Boundary Road roundabout and an exit into Cantonments from the Giffard Road Interchange.  
It consists of one mainline bridge, two ramp bridges, four auxiliary roads, and ancillary works. At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project had made physical progress of 70%.  
In the Central Region, the PIAC Team, led by Nana Kweku Dei, a member representing the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College, a 90-bed Hostel Block at Saltpond, and an irrigation infrastructure at Mprumem. 
Accompanied by officials of the Mfantseman Municipal Assembly, the team inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College Project, which had received an amount of GH¢9,507,111.52 from the ABFA from 2012 to 2022.  
The project comprises an 18-Unit Classroom Block, Hostel facility, Administration Block, and a Laboratory.  
Since the Committee’s last visit to the project in 2020, the construction of a teachers’ bungalow has started, and a road contract has been awarded.  
The 4.6km road project, which starts within the campus and ends at the main Accra-Cape Coast highway, is currently at Phase 1 (Sub-base).  
The road contract, originally valued at GH¢8 million has been through three (3) variation orders and is currently valued at approximately GH¢27 million, primarily due to payment delays.  
The Committee also notes that the hostel facility and the 18-unit classroom block had not been fitted with beds and study desks, respectively.  
Also, the laboratory, classroom block and hostel facilities had developed structural defects at the time of PIAC’s inspection. 
In line with the Committee’s policy of visiting projects that have received funding from the ABFA and have been completed, the team inspected a 90-bed Hostel Block for the Ghana Education Service Development Institute (GESDI) at Saltpond.  
The project had received an amount of GH¢1,456,960.92 from the ABFA in 2015. GESDI is a Ghana Education Service (GES) Centre for capacity building in education-related programmes and seminars.  
The project was commissioned in 2020 with a 90-bed capacity hostel block, four (4) washrooms, two conference halls and a 100-person capacity cafeteria.  
The Committee was satisfied with the overall quality of the project.  
Accompanied by the Central Regional Manager of the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), the team inspected a third project, which was the development of an irrigation infrastructure at Mprumem.  
The project received GH¢45.078 million from the ABFA from 2017 to 2020. The irrigation project, which was started in 2015, overlaps the Gomoa Central and Gomoa West Districts.  
It comprises a reservoir area; which stores water from River Bushen for irrigation, and the developed area; which has 70 hectares of irrigable land.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project (now known as the Mprumem Irrigation Scheme) had been completed and was in use by farmers in the vicinity for vegetable farming. 
Across all the projects visited, the issue of delayed payments to contractors was noted. 
The release of funds for the projects to progress uninterruptedly was highlighted by the contractors at the various sites.  
PIAC believes that the co-mingling of petroleum revenues with other funds for projects that end up getting stalled for a long period does not reflect the prudent use of revenues for impact.  
The Committee therefore urged the government to consider channelling adequate petroleum revenues to complete earmarked projects going forward. 
After the inspection in Accra, the Chair of the Committee expressed concern about the paltry sums of petroleum revenues allocated to some ongoing infrastructure projects in the country.  
She noted that the allocated funds, which are channelled to these projects through the Annual Budget Funding Amount, did not indicate significant contributions to the total funds of these projects.  
PIAC, she said, would continue to make its case for more prudent use of the country’s petroleum revenues, to ensure that enough funds were committed to complete earmarked projects.  
Emerita Professor Ardayfio-Schandorf expressed gratitude to the Assembly Officials and stakeholders who contributed to the success of the inspections.  
The Committee remains committed to the promotion of transparency and accountability in the management of the country’s petroleum revenues,  
as enshrined in the Petroleum Revenue Management Act (PRMA), 2011 as amended.

Ho, Jan. 14, GNA – Works have begun on a 1.2-kilometre road in the Ho Municipality that connects to the Aflao highway in the Volta Region, under the Ghana Secondary Cities Support Programme.  
 Mr Divine Bosson, the Ho Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), told the media during a tour of the project, that the road, known as the (Oxygen City Street), would open up many fast-growing communities in the area. 
“The Oxygen City Street will give meaning to the oxygen city concept. It will have a two-sided drain and we will demonstrate the environmental concept with trees etc.” 
The project is being undertaken by Messrs First Sky, and, when completed, would enable works on a major bridge across the south-bound highway to progress. 
The MCE showed the press some wrongly cited buildings obstructing the road project and said all those buildings would be pulled down. 
The team, comprising planners and engineers from the Assembly, inspected works on other roads including a popular alternative route to the market, informally named the “scrap road.” 
Work is also expected to be completed on a bridge connecting the Ho Central Market, the neglect of which had seen several demonstrations to draw attention to its completion. 
A short strategic road in the heart of town, which had been sealed off with unauthorised buildings, is also being constructed. 
The MCE had taken the initiative to open up the road and several others like it in the Municipality, when he assumed office. 
Mr Bosson said more than two kilometres of roads would be completed within nine months for GHC6.6 million sourced from the Third Installment of the World Bank’s Urban Development Grant. 
Roads in the central market would also be upgraded, he said and reminded traders there to free up the curbs for the works to commence. 
The First Sky and Openya Construction Ltd are undertaking the projects.

Accra-Kumasi Highway Dualisation: Road Minister inspects progress of four by-passes 
Konongo (Ash), Jan. 04, GNA – Mr Kwasi Amoako -Atta, Minister for Roads, and Highways, has expressed satisfaction about the progress of work on the four by-passes currently under construction, as part of the Accra-Kumasi highway dualisation project. 
     He applauded all eight contractors working on the projects who are Ghanaian firms for making a strong case for local contractors by delivering quality work. 
       The Minister who was inspecting the projects made up of the Osino by-pass, Anyinam by-pass, Enyiresi by-pass and Konongo by-pass, said local contractors were deliberately selected in line with the Presidents vision to promote local content in project execution. 
      Accompanied by officials of the Ghana Highway Authority (GHA), Mr. Amoako-Atta inspected all four project sites and interacted with the contractors to learn at first hand their challenges and how to address them. 
      The four by-pass projects which are being executed at a cost of GH¢1.9 billion are 45 kilometres in total. 
      The expectation is that, travelling hours and congestion on the central corridor would significantly reduce upon completion of the projects in 30 months, except for the Konongo by-pass, which is scheduled for completion in 36 months. 
      Current work being done at the various sites visited by the Minister are demolishing and site clearing, earth works, culverts and drainage, as well as concrete works. 
      Common challenges confronting the projects as narrated by the contractors included low hanging high tension cables, existing deep galamsay pits, and new galamsay activities in the Birim River. 
      Others are compensation issues and difficulty in getting gravel material because of farms along the stretch. 
      The Minister promised to engage relevant stakeholders to find solutions to the challenges to ensure smooth execution of the projects, saying that the national interest must prevail over all others. 
       “The selection of eight different contractors to handle this project was informed by the fact that we wanted the work to be carried out simultaneously with the same speed,” he pointed out. 
     He stated that, “I keep on saying that President Akuffo Addo’s government for the past seven years has built capacities of local contractors to handle road works of any magnitude in this country.” 
      He said the President promised to continue the dualisation of the Accra-Kumasi highway in 2018 and that he remained committed to redeeming the promise. 
    Government would continue to stand solidly behind local contractors to empower them to play significant role in national development, he assured. 
      He said the government was determined to ensure sustainable funding for the project, allaying fear of the possibility of the project being stalled along the way.

2024 is “Year of Completion”— Roads Minister | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Accra, Dec. 13, GNA – Mr Kwasi Amoako – Attah, Minister of Roads and Highways, has declared next year, 2024, as a “Year of Completion” to complete all commissioned and stalled roads projects in the country. 
He said the Ministry would ensure that all road projects, which started from 2017, especially projects in 2020 and 2021 under the “Year of Roads”, were completed by the end of 2024. 
Mr Amoako-Attah said this at an inspection of a soon-to-start two dual carriage road projects at Kasoa and Adentan. 
They comprised a 30 kilometre Kasoa to Winneba Roundabout dual carriage road and a 23-kilometre Adentan to Dodowa dual carriage road. 
The two projects will commence officially on January 01, 2024, after preparatory work and mobilisation are done. 
The Kasoa to Winneba dual carriage stretch would have double service lanes on each side, intersections and flyovers at Kasoa-Buduburam and Winneba Junction and would be completed in 36 months. 
The Adentan to Dodowa stretch would also be a dual carriage with double lanes on each side with service lanes and intersections and completed in 24 months. 
The Kasoa project is being undertaken by Nag Fairmount Company Limited, whereas the Adentan one is being done by Oswal Investments Limited; all local contractors. 
The Minister said the Kasoa and Adentan projects were part of four critical projects the Ministry would be undertaking in the year alongside the completion of existing ones. 
“These two road projects when completed will bring relief to the public, since it would ease traffic and make it safer to use the roads. They are two critical road networks that need to be dualised and opened to ease the stress on using them,” he added. 
Mr Amoako-Attah said the Ministry had in the last seven years built the capacity of more than 20 local contractors to enable them handle critical road projects. 
The Minister said the contractors had been instructed to work 24/7 to complete the projects on schedule.

Preparation for the dualisation of Kasoa-Winneba Road in the offing  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Preparation for the dualisation of Kasoa-Winneba Road in the offing 
Cape Coast, Dec. 08, GNA – The Ghana Highway Authority (GHA) has advanced the designing for the dualisation of the 34- 34-kilometre road from Kasoa to Winneba-junction, Mrs Mercy A. Payne, the Central Regional Director of the Authority has hinted. 
The designing would soon end for procurement processes to begin to select an efficient contractor for work to begin on the busy stretch to ease the chaotic vehicular traffic to improve travel time whilst addressing congestion issues. 
As part of the plan, major road intersections, particularly Akotsi junction noted for standstill traffic, would be redesigned to segregate the local traffic from the highway traffic. 
Though tight-lipped about the date for commencement of work, Mrs Payne assured of the Government’s commitment to have that stretch dualised, noting that: “Currently, the road capacity cannot accommodate the current traffic stress. 
“The intended construction is part of the broader Accra-Mankessim-Cape Coast dualisation being done in phases to boost tourism, attract and retain investments to the historic Region.” 
Mrs Payne was briefing members of the Central Regional Coordinating Council about the state of the Region’s roads during its meeting to take stock of development issues in the Region in accordance with the Local Government Act, (Act 932). 
In attendance were Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives, Presiding Members and heads of decentralized Ministries, Departments, and Agencies, traditional and religious authorities, security agencies and the media. 
Mrs Payne also proposed a proper market to build at the 400-acre land onion market at Gomoa Fetteh which she described as “a fast-looming slum.” 
According to her, the scheme for the onion market as part of the dualisation of the road would ensure dedicated lanes for commuters to help avoid accidents. 
“The current situation where people just enter the market anyhow and leave, whilst drivers stop at any point to pick passengers for others to enter or leave is not the best. 
 …so, the whole place is becoming chaotic as the plantain and fish sellers have all joined in,” she explained. 
Touching on other ongoing road projects, she mentioned the Winneba-junction –Agona Swedru Road, Swedru-Afransi-Ajumako Road, Potsin junction-Potsin Road, 
Others are the partial reconstruction of sections of Cape Coast-Twifo Praso and sectional repair works on the 08 – (Yamoransa-Assin Fosu highway) to reduce the rampant road accidents between Winneba junction-Mankessim. 
For the situation of the road mix, Mrs Payne explained that the Region has a total of 1,180.7 kilometres of highway roads covering a land size of 9,826 km² for the estimated 2,859,821 population. 
Of the total road network, 852.5 km are paved representing 72.2 per cent, whilst 328.2 km are unpaved resenting 27.8 per cent. 
About 295.8 km are good representing 24.0 per cent, 694.6 km are fair representing 58.0 per cent and 210.3 km representing 18.0 per cent is in a poor state. 
Mrs Payne also underscored major challenges including the suspension of road works due to delays in payment of contractors, and encroachment on the right of way which disrupts road expansion due to huge payments of compensation. 
Others are; excessive axle loading, vandalism of road furniture, illegal speed humps, road accidents, illegal access to trunk roads, traffic congestion and bottlenecks due to commercial activities, particularly at Akotsi-junction and Buduburam.  
For urban roads, Mr Jacob Nelson, Regional Director of Urban Roads said his outfit operated in eight Assemblies including Cape Coast, Agona West, Assin Fosu, Upper Denkyira East, Komenda-Edina-Eguafo-Abrem (KEEA), Awutu Senya East, Efutu and Mfantseman. 
He said the Region had a total of 1389.98 urban roads comprising 945.97km of unpaved roads representing 68 per cent and 444.01km of paved roads representing 32 per cent. 
Though he was elated about some major upcoming projects in Abrem-Kafodzidzi road in KEEA, and Eguasi-Amosima-Nkanfoa town roads, he was concerned about myriad of challenges stifling their work. 
Key among them are the pilfering of traffic light cables at Pedu junction, encroachments on road reservations, damage to the road caused by pipe leakages and repairs by the Ghana Water Company Limited. 
Mrs Justina Marigold Assan, the Central Regional Minister in a speech read on her behalf, commended the Assemblies and other stakeholders for their hard work in various regional programmes such as the Farmers Day and HIV/AIDS celebrations, Central Expo, and sanitation interventions. 
Ahead of the District Assembly elections, she underlined the need for all candidates and followers to conduct clean campaigns devoid of rancour and acrimony to maintain the peace in the Region.

Volta Region received unprecedented road infrastructure under NPP — Akufo-Addo   | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Volta Region received unprecedented road infrastructure under NPP — Akufo-Addo  
Ho, Nov. 6, GNA – President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says the Volta region had seen unprecedented road infrastructure under the New Patriotic Party (NPP) government.   
He said the government had constructed 432 kilometres of road since assuming office in January 2017.  
President Akufo-Addo said these when addressing chiefs and people of the Anlo State at a durbar in Anloga to mark the 2023 Hogbetsotso festival, under the theme: “Climate Change, a Challenge to Lands below Sea Level, a Concern of the Anlo State and the Stakeholders.”  
He said the roads include the completion of the dualisation of the 22km Ho main road.   
He said others were the 30km Have to Kpando road, the upgrading of the Golokwati -Wli road, resealing of the 15km Asikuma junction to Ho Road, regravelling of the 30km Frankadua to Adidome road and the surfacing of the 17.8km Matse-Klave and Lume Atsiame-Avetokoe roads.  
President Akufo-Addo said other roads were asphaltic overlay on 15km of town roads in Hohoe; bitumen surfacing of the 15.6km Akwetey-Adaklu-Waya feeder road and bitumen surfacing of Bume-Danyigba-Anfoega road.   
He mentioned the Danyigba Town Roads, Dra-Sabadu road, and Bume-Agata road; bitumen surfacing of the 12km Yorkitikpo-Kpoviadzi-Trepe road.  
President Akufo-Addo said the rest were the bitumen surfacing of the 9.7km Mafi-Adadepo, Wute/Yorkitikpo and Kpoviadzi feeder roads; bitumen surfacing of the 9.7km Liati Agbonyira-Fodome-Ahor road; and the upgrading of 2.5 km Klefe town roads.  
He said work was also steadily ongoing on the 5.3km Ho By-Pass dualisation project which was 37 per cent complete, as is work on the upgrading of 8km of selected roads in Ketu South, which is 48 per cent complete.  
President Akufo-Addo said construction work on the Eastern Corridor Roads had progressed in sharp contrast to what had been done at the end of 2016, which saw only 135km of the roads, representing 27 per cent in good condition.  
“As at the end of 2022, 366 km, that is 74 per cent of the Corridor had improved from poor to good state. This has had a positive impact on the movement of goods and people along the corridor.”  
He said government had cancelled the contracts awarded to contractors working on the Aflao to Denu to Dzodze to Ave Afiadenyigba to Ave Dakpa to Ho Road.  
President Akufo-Addo said contracts of contractors on the Denu to Havedzi to Keta Road, Srogbe to Anyanui road, Agortoe Junction to Tregbui to Adutor road, Anyako to Seva road and the Weta to Metsrikasa road had also been terminated since most of the contractors failed to carry out the works.  
He said the Ministry of Roads and Highways had decided to terminate the current contracts and re-package them for the award.  
President Akufo-Addo said in the short term, the mobile maintenance unit of the Ghana Highway Authority would be deployed to undertake emergency maintenance of the very critical sections of the roads.  
He said the government had also secured funding of 89 United States million dollars from the African Development Bank towards the construction of the 29.35 km Asutsuare Junction to Volivo road.   
President Akufo-Addo said other roads to benefit included the 39.2 km Dorfor Adidome to Asikuma Junction Road, the 23.9km Asutsuare Junction to Aveyime road, and two interchanges at Dorfor Adidome and Asikuma Junction.  
He said procurement processes were underway to start the roads by the first quarter of 2024.

Volta Region received unprecedented road infrastructure under NPP — Akufo-Addo  
Ho, Nov. 6, GNA – President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says the Volta region had seen unprecedented road infrastructure under the New Patriotic Party (NPP) government.   
He said the government had constructed 432 kilometres of road since assuming office in January 2017.  
President Akufo-Addo said these when addressing chiefs and people of the Anlo State at a durbar in Anloga to mark the 2023 Hogbetsotso festival, under the theme: “Climate Change, a Challenge to Lands below Sea Level, a Concern of the Anlo State and the Stakeholders.”  
He said the roads include the completion of the dualisation of the 22km Ho main road.   
He said others were the 30km Have to Kpando road, the upgrading of the Golokwati -Wli road, resealing of the 15km Asikuma junction to Ho Road, regravelling of the 30km Frankadua to Adidome road and the surfacing of the 17.8km Matse-Klave and Lume Atsiame-Avetokoe roads.  
President Akufo-Addo said other roads were asphaltic overlay on 15km of town roads in Hohoe; bitumen surfacing of the 15.6km Akwetey-Adaklu-Waya feeder road and bitumen surfacing of Bume-Danyigba-Anfoega road.   
He mentioned the Danyigba Town Roads, Dra-Sabadu road, and Bume-Agata road; bitumen surfacing of the 12km Yorkitikpo-Kpoviadzi-Trepe road.  
President Akufo-Addo said the rest were the bitumen surfacing of the 9.7km Mafi-Adadepo, Wute/Yorkitikpo and Kpoviadzi feeder roads; bitumen surfacing of the 9.7km Liati Agbonyira-Fodome-Ahor road; and the upgrading of 2.5 km Klefe town roads.  
He said work was also steadily ongoing on the 5.3km Ho By-Pass dualisation project which was 37 per cent complete, as is work on the upgrading of 8km of selected roads in Ketu South, which is 48 per cent complete.  
President Akufo-Addo said construction work on the Eastern Corridor Roads had progressed in sharp contrast to what had been done at the end of 2016, which saw only 135km of the roads, representing 27 per cent in good condition.  
“As at the end of 2022, 366 km, that is 74 per cent of the Corridor had improved from poor to good state. This has had a positive impact on the movement of goods and people along the corridor.”  
He said government had cancelled the contracts awarded to contractors working on the Aflao to Denu to Dzodze to Ave Afiadenyigba to Ave Dakpa to Ho Road.  
President Akufo-Addo said contracts of contractors on the Denu to Havedzi to Keta Road, Srogbe to Anyanui road, Agortoe Junction to Tregbui to Adutor road, Anyako to Seva road and the Weta to Metsrikasa road had also been terminated since most of the contractors failed to carry out the works.  
He said the Ministry of Roads and Highways had decided to terminate the current contracts and re-package them for the award.  
President Akufo-Addo said in the short term, the mobile maintenance unit of the Ghana Highway Authority would be deployed to undertake emergency maintenance of the very critical sections of the roads.  
He said the government had also secured funding of 89 United States million dollars from the African Development Bank towards the construction of the 29.35 km Asutsuare Junction to Volivo road.   
President Akufo-Addo said other roads to benefit included the 39.2 km Dorfor Adidome to Asikuma Junction Road, the 23.9km Asutsuare Junction to Aveyime road, and two interchanges at Dorfor Adidome and Asikuma Junction.  
He said procurement processes were underway to start the roads by the first quarter of 2024.

Fix Kasoa Highway — Ga South Municipality Residents Appeal  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Kasoa (C/R), Oct. 24, GNA – Hundreds of protestors in the Ga South Municipality have marched on the Mallam-Kasoa highway to protest the traffic situation commuters endure on daily basis which is compounded when it rains. 
Organized by Accra FM of the Class Media Group, the event had a hash tag “Fix Kasoa Highway.”  
The demonstrators converged at the Tuba taxi rank and marched on the highway to Barrier where it submitted a petition to authorities of the Assembly.  
They blocked both sides of the road from Accra to Kasoa and vice versa leading to a heavy traffic for more than two hours as they displayed placards with inscriptions “Drop The Cathedral And Fix Kasoa Highway,” “We Are No More Spectators, Fix Kasoa Roads,” “The IMF Money Can Fix Kasoa Highway,” “Families dey chop Ghanaians dey die, save our lives” and “King Promise do something before you go”.  
Mainly made up of the youth, drivers, and residents the demonstrators vented out their frustrations as passengers complained over delays in traffic, drivers lamented over burning of fuel and frequent maintenance of their vehicles due to the bad nature of the roads. 
At Tuba, heaps of mudslide of erosion from a hill which had settled on the road, right after the tollbooth towards broadcasting all in the Ga South municipality resulted in a heavy traffic. 
Portions of the road had developed huge potholes because of the mudslide, caused by sand winning activities in the area. 
At Bortianor, Ayigbe Town to Barrier and its surrounding communities the roads were flooded making it unmotorable and this had claimed lives over the years.  
The protestors stopped at vital spots including the office of the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Constituency, Mr Sylvester Mensah Tetteh and demanded to see him but met his absence. 
A swift intervention of the police prevented the demonstrators from vandalising his office.   
Minutes after, there was a clash between the demonstrators and an anti-landguard squad of the Ghana Police Service, which the demonstrators claimed were called in by the MP for the area. 
They said, Road Minister, Mr Kwasi Amoako-Atta, had visited the area together with engineers from the Municipal Assembly, Roads and Highway Department and the Ministry but had since not been attended to. 
They had demanded the presence of the Road Minister or the MCE to submit their petition but the municipal engineer, Ing Daniel Nii Sowah received it from Ms Elaine Attoh, convenor who gave government two-week ultimatum to begin works or they would hit the streets again. 
He received the petition on behalf of the Municipal Chief Executive, Mr Joseph Nyarni and assured them that the petition would be delivered for onward submission to the President.  
Mr Akwasi Addo, a lead person who doubles as the central regional correspondent of Metro TV said many commuters spent productive hours in traffic each day especially when it rained. 
He said that he had personally lost a job opportunity in Accra due to the daily heavy traffic on that stretch.  
He called on government to as a matter of urgency fix the problem to mitigate the challenges on the stretch.

Three communities in Amansie South to benefit from two-kilometre road
Manso-Aponapong (Ash), Aug. 29, GNA – Goldline Mining Ghana Limited, a mining company based in the Amansie South District of the Ashanti Region, is rehabilitating a two-kilometre road linking three communities in the district to the main Manso-Adubia road.
The communities are Kensere, Wahaso and Aponapong, which have been cut-off from the rest of the district due to the breakdown of their bridges and the bad nature of the road.
The rehabilitation work would involve reshaping, reconstruction of the bridges and culverts, as well as tarring.
Mr Emmanuel Ababio, the Chief Executive Officer of the company, told newsmen during an inspection of the road that the rehabilitation was to ensure the free movement of goods and services to boost economic activities.
He said good road infrastructure was critical to the development of Ghana since about 95 per cent of goods and services were transported by road.
Roads, therefore, made a significant contribution to the country’s economic development and growth with important social benefits.
Mr Ababio said upon hearing that the bridges in the area had broken down after the recent rains, the company saw the need to build new ones and construct the adjoining roads.
He said Goldline Mining Ghana Ltd was undertaking responsible mining and exploration through environmental and land reclamation, encouraging commercial agriculture as well as implementing infrastructural development in its catchment areas.
The CEO called on Ghanaians to be responsible and protect all natural resources in their communities.
Mr Clement Opoku Gyamfi, the District Chief Executive, Amansie South, lauded the mining company for its developmental agenda and complementing the government’s efforts in infrastructure development.
He advised community members to support the work by protecting the materials, which were being used in the construction works, from being stolen.
Maame Yaa Pomaa, a resident of Aponapong, told the Ghana News Agency that she appreciated the company’s initiative to construct the road.
“The bad roads in the area have been a headache for many farmers since they cannot connect easily to their customers when they harvest their produce,” she said.

Community hosting multimillion waste treatment facility cut off by bad roads
Ho, Aug. 15, GNA – The community of Akrofu, in the Ho Municipality, is appealing to the government to consider the development of its roads as it completes an ambitious multi-million waste treatment complex there.
The community, host of the Volta Regional capital’s waste dump site, is currently witnessing the construction of several individual waste treatment plants that would culminate into one of the largest in the country.
Mamaga Akua Sabea VII, Queenmother of the community, was chairing the commissioning of a medical waste treatment facility that had been completed at the complex and said the bad roads in the area were impacting negatively on the huge investment.
The Akrofo to Bame road helps provide the shortest access to the Eastern Corridor Highway from Ho, and recorded heavy traffic until the approximately 10 km feeder infrastructure lost its graphite overlay due to erosion
Only patches of graphite remain, and the Queenmother said the stretch had become a haven for robbers while the community lost access to markets in Kpeve and others on the Eastern corridor.
Mamaga Akua Sabea said the bad roads were affecting the farming community, which was getting recognised as a sustainable food basket in the area.
“No vehicle comes to the community after 1800 hours. We are kind of isolated because of our roads,” she lamented.
The medical waste treatment plant is built by Zoomlion, Ghana’s leading waste company, and the second to be completed as part of the government’s drive to develop a comprehensive sanitation structure.
A 15 million cedis integrated recycling and compost plant is also ongoing by same company at the complex and nearing completion, while a liquid waste treatment facility stands completed.
Residents of the community told the GNA of challenges with commuting along the stretch and said access to farms and other investments had become difficult, especially during the rainy season.
The commercial drivers that use the road have hiked their fees for their services, which has been limited to market days.
The situation seems to play into the hands of the regional capital as most farm produce now flows to Ho Central Market.

87 per cent of contracts under Cocoa Road Improvement Programme awarded through "non-competitive routes" - Auditor-General | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
87 per cent of contracts under Cocoa Road Improvement Programme awarded through “non-competitive routes” – Auditor-General
Accra, Aug. 2 GNA – The Auditor-General says 87 per cent of road contracts under the Cocoa Road Improvement Programme (CRIP II) from 2015 to 2021 were awarded through “non-competitive routes” .
This has resulted in higher costs in the construction of those roads compared to contracts awarded through competitive tendering.
This is revealed in the June 2023 Performance Audit Report on the Construction of Cocoa Roads within the period.
The report said Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) awarded 266 road contracts for CRIP II, measuring a total length of 4,100km for rehabilitation, upgrading and construction in the selected cocoa growing areas.
Out of this, 33 contracts were through competitive bidding, while 175 went through single source procurement with 58 going through restricted tendering, making majority of the road contracts passing through non-competitive routes.
According to the report, the reasons provided by COCOBOD for using those procurement methods did not align with the requirements of the Public Procurement Act.
It said despite the positive outcomes of completed cocoa roads, the audit identified areas that required improvement to ensure the sustainability of the Programme.  
The findings also indicated that COCOBOD did not prioritise road projects under the CRIP ll to match the amount of money available for the projects.  
Although COCOBOD sought input from subsidiaries and the Department of Feeder Roads to identify critical roads, there was no evidence of proper prioritisation.  
“This led to COCOBOD implementing more road projects than the budget for CRIP could support,” the report said.
It said the estimates COCOBOD used for the Cocoa road projects were not adequate for their implementation.  
The estimates were made based on line diagrams instead of detailed designs and as a result, there were significant variances between estimated costs and contract sums, ranging from 4.68 per cent to 99.7 per cent.
According to the report, inspections revealed defects in completed roads, including potholes, disintegrating surfaces, and cracks in concrete drains and the consultants did not visit the project sites regularly and issued only a few defect notices to the contractors without follow-up for rectification.  
“The consultants cited non- payment of fees by COCOBOD as the reason for their inadequate supervision,” it said.
The road works in CRIP l and CRIP II experienced delays due to COCOBOD’s failure to ensure timely payment to contractors.  
The Board did not plan for alternative funding to bridge the gap and did not ensure that contractors worked diligently to complete the road works on schedule.
It recommended that COCOBOD developed and implemented a detailed plan and strategy to prioritise road projects based on factors such as budget, road conditions, and cocoa production areas.
It also said the General Services Department of the Board should endeavour to consult Ghana Highway Authority and the Department of Feeder Roads for the right adjustments to be made to the estimates when budgeting for the programme so that adequate resources would be allocated.
The report also recommended that COCOBOD should seek expert advice to analyse procurement options and ensure better value for money.
They should also prioritise supervision of the road works and provide the necessary resources to the consultants for active supervision and ensure rectification of defective works.
“COCOBOD should suspend awarding new contracts until all existing contracts are completed and paid for,” it added.
To mitigate the challenge of the poor road conditions in cocoa-growing areas, the Government launched the Cocoa Road Improvement Programme (CRIP) in 2015 in collaboration with the Ministry of Roads and Highways with COCOBOD as the implementing agency and financier.
The objective is to improve 2,900km of roads to ensure the smooth and fast conveyance of cocoa beans from the farms to the purchasing centres and seaports to reduce post-harvest losses.

87 per cent of contracts under Cocoa Road Improvement Programme awarded through “non-competitive routes” – Auditor-General
Accra, Aug. 2 GNA – The Auditor-General says 87 per cent of road contracts under the Cocoa Road Improvement Programme (CRIP II) from 2015 to 2021 were awarded through “non-competitive routes” .
This has resulted in higher costs in the construction of those roads compared to contracts awarded through competitive tendering.
This is revealed in the June 2023 Performance Audit Report on the Construction of Cocoa Roads within the period.
The report said Ghana Cocoa Board (COCOBOD) awarded 266 road contracts for CRIP II, measuring a total length of 4,100km for rehabilitation, upgrading and construction in the selected cocoa growing areas.
Out of this, 33 contracts were through competitive bidding, while 175 went through single source procurement with 58 going through restricted tendering, making majority of the road contracts passing through non-competitive routes.
According to the report, the reasons provided by COCOBOD for using those procurement methods did not align with the requirements of the Public Procurement Act.
It said despite the positive outcomes of completed cocoa roads, the audit identified areas that required improvement to ensure the sustainability of the Programme.  
The findings also indicated that COCOBOD did not prioritise road projects under the CRIP ll to match the amount of money available for the projects.  
Although COCOBOD sought input from subsidiaries and the Department of Feeder Roads to identify critical roads, there was no evidence of proper prioritisation.  
“This led to COCOBOD implementing more road projects than the budget for CRIP could support,” the report said.
It said the estimates COCOBOD used for the Cocoa road projects were not adequate for their implementation.  
The estimates were made based on line diagrams instead of detailed designs and as a result, there were significant variances between estimated costs and contract sums, ranging from 4.68 per cent to 99.7 per cent.
According to the report, inspections revealed defects in completed roads, including potholes, disintegrating surfaces, and cracks in concrete drains and the consultants did not visit the project sites regularly and issued only a few defect notices to the contractors without follow-up for rectification.  
“The consultants cited non- payment of fees by COCOBOD as the reason for their inadequate supervision,” it said.
The road works in CRIP l and CRIP II experienced delays due to COCOBOD’s failure to ensure timely payment to contractors.  
The Board did not plan for alternative funding to bridge the gap and did not ensure that contractors worked diligently to complete the road works on schedule.
It recommended that COCOBOD developed and implemented a detailed plan and strategy to prioritise road projects based on factors such as budget, road conditions, and cocoa production areas.
It also said the General Services Department of the Board should endeavour to consult Ghana Highway Authority and the Department of Feeder Roads for the right adjustments to be made to the estimates when budgeting for the programme so that adequate resources would be allocated.
The report also recommended that COCOBOD should seek expert advice to analyse procurement options and ensure better value for money.
They should also prioritise supervision of the road works and provide the necessary resources to the consultants for active supervision and ensure rectification of defective works.
“COCOBOD should suspend awarding new contracts until all existing contracts are completed and paid for,” it added.
To mitigate the challenge of the poor road conditions in cocoa-growing areas, the Government launched the Cocoa Road Improvement Programme (CRIP) in 2015 in collaboration with the Ministry of Roads and Highways with COCOBOD as the implementing agency and financier.
The objective is to improve 2,900km of roads to ensure the smooth and fast conveyance of cocoa beans from the farms to the purchasing centres and seaports to reduce post-harvest losses.

Government to embark on community roads improvement programme
Accra, July 31, GNA – Government will embark on a community roads improvement programme to increase productivity and facilitate the transportation of food crops, Mr Ken Ofori Attah, Finance Minister has said.
According to him, Districts Assemblies would be given complementary equipment to ensure that their local roads were motorable throughout the year.
Delivering the 2023 Mid-Year Fiscal Policy Review, on Monday, in Parliament, the finance minister noted that these notwithstanding, Government was committed to improving road infrastructure in line with the fiscal consolidation plan in the IMF-backed PCPEG and in partnership with the private sector.
He said to improve mobility and accessibility, as well as safety along major trunk roads, several projects were at various stages of completion:
“Works on the 31.2 km Assin Fosu-Assin Praso portion of the National Trunk Road N8 (Phase 2) was completed and commissioned in June 2023; Accra-Tema Beach Road Lot 1is 79 percent complete while Lot 2 is 89 percent complete, construction of a 3-tier interchange at Nungua Barrier is ongoing, and development works on the Kumasi Lake Road and Drainage Extension project was 98 percent complete.”
Mr Ofori-Attah said selected roads in Sekondi and Takoradi Phase 1 was 21 percent complete; Tema-Aflao Road was 30 percent complete; Nsawam-Ofankor road was 26 percent complete; reconstruction of Bechem-Techimantia-Akomadan road was 64 percent complete; reconstruction of Agona Nkwanta-Tarkwa road was 34 percent complete, while phase 2 of the Obetsebi Lamptey Circle Interchange and other ancillary works was 86 percent complete as of June 2023.
“Construction of a 4-tier interchange at Suame in the Ashanti Region has commenced; Construction of 50 prefabricated bridges in all sixteen regions continued in 2023 and are 86 percent complete as at end June; design, fabrication and delivery of 87 No. steel panel bridges is ongoing, with 45 bridges delivered; and new bridge under construction at Twifo Praso to separate vehicular traffic from the railway line is 93 percent complete. 125. “
The finance minister also noted that the Road Sector’s Public Private Partnerships (PPP) programme for the financing, construction and management of road infrastructure has two projects at different stages of preparation.
“Phase 1 of the Accra-Tema Motorway Extension Project (31.7km) involves the reconstruction of the Motorway. The Concession Agreement and draft Engineering Procurement and Construction (EPC) agreement have been finalized and will be laid in this House. And the Development of Tema Arterial Roads will be structured on a PPP basis using the Build Operate and Transfer (BOT) model. The appraisal of the project is ongoing.”

MP for Shama lobby's for road improvement in the district | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Shama (WR), July 19, GNA – Mr Erickson Abakah, the Member of Parliament for the Shama constituency says, roads in the district will soon witness some reshaping and asphalting to halt the transportation challenges in the area.
Already, plans were far advanced with the government, to procure a contractor to move to site in the next few months.
Mr Abakah told the Ghana News Agency in an interview that, CORE construction, a renowned civil engineering company in good standing would undertake the repair works.
The company, he said, would start with the reshaping and asphalting of the main Shama Junction to Shama township road, Komfeku and Nyankrom roads among others.
The Member of Parliament has therefore, called on residents in the district to exercise restraints as the government made moves to improve on road network in the area.
Earlier in the month of July, some residents of the district, together with some GPRTU executives took to the Street in protest of the bad road network in most streets within the area.
The almost six hours demonstration saw protestors wielding placards, chanting war songs and blocking major entrances with tyres set ablaze.
They hoisted placards which read: ‘Shama road is total wickedness’, enough of the deception’, Oh! Why are we neglected?’, Are we aliens?’, Why are you punishing us?’, “The hospital is a mirage’, and ‘It’s our right to have good roads’.
They complained that, over the years, their road network had deteriorated and that, successive governments had failed to listen to their concerns, thereby creating untold hardships in Shama district economically.
The residents added that, the deplorable road condition from Nyankrom to the Takoradi -Accra highway worsened especially during heavy rains, adding that, social and economic life were seriously affected.
The demonstrators, disrupted academic and business activities in the area for the day and only took the intervention of the Regional Police Commander, ACP Akoto Osei, to allow some sanity to prevail temporarily.
The situation necessitated police reinforcement to restore order.
Nana Akosua Gyamfuaba, the Queen Mother of Nyankrom was sad that the area had not benefitted from even a half kilometre road tarred under the year of roads concept by the government.
The GPRTU Chairman, Mr John Armoo, also spoke about the ‘pains’ drivers endured in plying the Nyankrom, Botogeyena, Komfeku, Aboadze, Abuesi routes and Shama district capital.
Nana Wurapa II, leader of the demonstrators said citizens could no more be spectators indeed.

Newmont Ahafo North sets to begin actual mining in 2025 | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Afrisipakrom (A/R), July 06, GNA – The actual mining at the Newmont Ahafo North Project of the Newmont Ghana Gold Limited (NGGL) is set to commence by the end of 2024.
Projecting to mine between 270,000 and 325,000 ounces of gold annually, the Ahafo North Project concessional area covers about 10,000 acres of land spread across five major communities in the Tano North Municipality of the region.
Mr Andries Havenga, the Project Director, Newmont Ahafo North disclosed this when he conducted Dr. Freda Prempeh, the Member of Parliament (MP) for Tano North round the project site at Afrisipakrom on Thursday.
They were accompanied by Messrs. Justice Fonteng and Joseph Danso, Mine Manager and Senior Manager, External Relations respectively of the Newmont Ahafo North Project
Mr Havenga explained major construction works were expected to be completed next year, saying works on the plant site, thermal and other facilities were progressing steadily.
He said the Ahafo North Mine was projected with a lifespan of 13 years.
On Environmental Management, Mr Danso said the Project had set up a department which monitored and managed noise, air, dust and water pollutions, adding the project was also effective preventive measures to improve the vegetative cover so that toxic materials would not silt into nearby streams.
“We are doing our best to control sediment and suppress the dust too”, he said.
On her part, Dr. Prempeh said the Tano North Municipality was endowed with numerous resources, including oil reserves in commercial quantities which could be explored for development.
She appealed to Newmont to endeavour to employ more of the locals in the area, saying “we also have mining engineers and other professionals who can work here”.
Dr. Prempeh, also a Minister of State at the office of the President called on the Mine to also engage and empower more women in the enclave to better their livelihoods.

Japan affirms commitment to Ghana’s infrastructure development  
Assin-Praso (C/R), June 28, GNA – Mr Hisanobu Mochizuki, the Japanese Ambassador to Ghana, has reaffirmed the country’s continued support to Ghana’s socio-economic and infrastructure development drive. 
He said Ghana held a strategically important position in developing quality infrastructure in the West Africa Growth Ring Corridor Development to enhance connectivity and promote economic activities in the sub-region. 
“Japan as a nation is aware of the value of creating a solid infrastructure base and the role it can play in boosting and stimulating economies. 
“This strengthens our resolve to help our colleagues in Africa develop their infrastructure to transform their economies,” the Ambassador assured. 
He made the declaration in a speech read on his behalf at the commissioning of a 31.2 km national trunk road (N8) phase two road stretching from Assin-Fosu to Assin-Praso in the Assin North District of the Central Region last Friday. 
The project was funded with a grant from the Japanese government and executed by Shimizu Dai Nippon Joint Ventures, a Japanese Construction Firm. 
Mr Mochizuki said the Japanese government had demonstrated a commitment to quality infrastructure development towards strengthening the foundation of Ghana’s industrial growth through agriculture, health, and human resource development. 
Transportation infrastructure remains crucial for promoting economic growth as well as business and investment in Ghana. Without it, he said products and services would become less valuable.  
Enhancing transportation connectivity with good roads, to him, opened up underserved communities to economic opportunity and promoted inclusive economic growth.  
Mr. Mochizuki said Japan’s assurance for development assistance was reinforced by a recent visit to Ghana by the Japanese Prime Minister, Fumio Kishida to deepen bilateral relations for mutual gain. 
The Japanese Government attached great significance to the promotion of business and investment in Ghana as a leading economic powerhouse in West Africa. 
“For instance, it is impossible to underline enough how strategically located this N8 highway is. 
“I am confident that the massive opportunities that these rehabilitation efforts of the N8 would bring to Ghana will be realized because it is a crucial corridor for the transportation of essential export commodities,” the Ambassador noted. 
To the people in the area, he said the road would undoubtedly reduce traffic, particularly on market days, and create more commercial opportunities in the surrounding communities. 
Notwithstanding, he recognized the contributions of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) for being a key conduit for the Japanese government’s strategic and all-encompassing approach to supporting Ghana’s infrastructure development.  
Through JICA, Ghana has benefited from infrastructure projects, including the high-quality Phase One of the Tema Motorway roundabout project officially opened by President Akufo-Addo in 2020. 
The sod-cutting by the Vice President, Dr. Mahamudu  Bawumia for the commencement of Phase Two of the project which is scheduled for completion in December 2024. 
Again, through the efforts of JICA, he said the Phase One Project of the NS between Assin-Praso and Asante-Bekwai was completed in December 2013.  
That accomplishment, he said, laid the groundwork for Phase Two and said, “I thank the Central Consultant Inc, the Japanese consultants who worked on the project, as well as Shimizu-Dai Nippon Joint Venture, the Japanese contractor who worked on the project, for their hard work and expertise.  
“Let me express the same gratitude to their Ghanaian counterparts, Ghana Highway Authority for their collaboration and cooperation,” he added.

VEEP commissions 31.2 KM Assin-Praso-Assin-Fosu Road | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Assin-Praso (C/R), June 23, GNA – Vice-President Dr. Mohamadu Bawumia on Friday, commissioned the $50 million Assin-Fosu to Assin-Praso N8 highway in the Assin North District of the Central Region.
The 31.2 km road project funded with the grant from the Japanese government, was executed by Shimizu Dai Nippon Joint Ventures, a construction firm, under the supervision of the Ghana Highways Authority.
It started on Monday, January 13, 2020, and was expected to be completed on Sunday, December 31, 2023.
The road would significantly facilitate the movement of goods, ensure easy access to markets and services, guarantee reductions in road accidents and road user costs, and improve travel time to enhance the social and economic lives of the people in the Assin area and beyond.
More than 18 kilometres of the road is through the Assin North Constituency and the project scope includes a 1.2-kilometre dual stretch within the Assin-Fosu township and new drainage systems.
Others are the construction of concrete pavements, and reconstruction of the railway underpass bridge with a reinforced box culvert among other ancillaries and dualization of a four-lane carriageway with a 1.2 km street lighting in Assin-Fosu.
The stretch formed part of the 176 km N8 starting from Yamoransa near Cape Coast through major towns such as Abura-Dunkwa, Assin-Fosu and Assin-Praso, which ends at Anwiankwanta in the Ashanti Region and connects the N1 to the northern part of Ghana.
The rehabilitation of the road being done in phases commenced with the first phase from Bekwai to Assin-Praso, which was completed in December 2013.
The N8 was originally constructed between 1990 and 1994 with funding from the government of Japan.
Commissioning the road, Vice-President Dr. Bawumia commended the Government of Japan for the gesture to better the lots of the people.
He was grateful to the contractor for working hard to complete the project on schedule despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic that stalled construction works for months.
The Vice President said as part of measures to ensure safety on the road, the Government would construct a disability friendly footbridge in Assin-Fosu to ensure pedestrian safety with a strong maintenance culture.
The construction of the road is a great step in the development of road infrastructure in Ghana to reduce travel and freight from the Western, Central, Ashanti to the Northern Regions and neighbouring countries.
“It is so beautiful to see this road so beautifully done. I’m so impressed with the work done, so this road is not a “green book” road but a “feeli-feeli,” Dr Bawumia stated.
The Vice-President promised subsequent completion of the remaining 67 km of road from Assin-Fosu to Yamoransa.
He mentioned some projects including the completion of a 70-meter span steel bridge at Kushea and the construction of a bridge over the river Pra at Twifo-Praso to separate vehicular traffic from rail over river Pra.
Others are the rehabilitation of 32 km Mankessim-Abura Dunkwa road, which is 80 percent complete, the upgrading of 15 km Assin-Asampanaye-Kushea that is 70 percent complete, and the upgrading of Akonfodi town road which is 50 percent complete.
He advised road users to adhere to basic road safety signs to reduce the occurrence of road accidents.
Mr. Kwasi Amoako Atta, Roads Minister, commended the contractor for using modern technology, which made good use of the old road material and urged other road contractors to emulate.
“The technology used is environmentally friendly,” he said, and commended them for the timely completion of the project to ease commuting challenges.
Ms Hisanobu Mochizuki, the Japanese Ambassador to Ghana, said Japan as a nation was aware of the value of creating a solid infrastructure base and the role it could play in boosting and stimulating economies.
That she said, had strengthened their resolve to help countries in Africa develop their infrastructure to transform their economies.
That reinforced the recent visit by the Japanese Prime Minister Kishida to Ghana and had a wonderful bilateral meeting with President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo at the Jubilee House.
She said the Japanese government attached great importance to the promotion of business and investment in Ghana, considered one of the leading economic centers in West Africa.
“Transportation infrastructure is crucial for promoting economic growth as well as business and investment in Ghana because without it, products and services will become less valuable.
“Enhancing transportation connectivity with good roads opens up underserved communities to economic opportunity and promotes inclusive economic growth,” she said.

Assin-Praso (C/R), June 23, GNA – Vice-President Dr. Mohamadu Bawumia on Friday, commissioned the $50 million Assin-Fosu to Assin-Praso N8 highway in the Assin North District of the Central Region.
The 31.2 km road project funded with the grant from the Japanese government, was executed by Shimizu Dai Nippon Joint Ventures, a construction firm, under the supervision of the Ghana Highways Authority.
It started on Monday, January 13, 2020, and was expected to be completed on Sunday, December 31, 2023.

We must do everything it takes to commence Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Project– Dr Bawumia   | Ghana News Agency

We must do everything it takes to commence Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Project– Dr Bawumia  
Accra, May 19, GNA – Vice President Dr Mahamudu Bawumia, has asked the four other Heads of State who are party to the implementation of the Abidjan-Lagos Highway Corridor Project to ensure that it commences next year.  
The construction of the homogenous highway corridor, linking Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire and Nigeria, was formally approved by Heads of State of ECOWAS member countries at the 42nd Ordinary Summit in February 2013. 
However, after more than a decade, the project is yet to commence. 
The Vice President, in a speech read on his behalf by Mr Yaw Osafo-Maafo, Senior Advisor to the President, at the opening of the 19th Steering Committee Meeting on the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway Project, in Accra, on Friday, said member countries “must do whatever it takes for the project to commence in 2024” as proposed. 
He explained that the commencement of the project would give real meaning to continental free trade. 
The meeting was to review the project’s implementation progress and discuss bottlenecks towards addressing all issues before the project commences. 
The meeting was attended by Ministers in charge of roads and/or infrastructure of the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor member countries of Benin, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria, and Togo. 
The Abidjan-Lagos Corridor is a six-lane (three-lane dual carriageway) covering a total distance of 1,028km and connects some of the largest and economically dynamic cities in Africa namely Lagos, Accra, Cotonou, Lomé, and Abidjan. 
It also covers a substantial proportion of West Africa and links very vibrant seaports, serving all the landlocked countries in the region- Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger. 
Ghana accounts for the longest section (576km) of the corridor, including a proposed 2.7km under tunnel from Ga East in the Greater Accra Region to Berekusu in the Eastern Region. 
The project, when completed, would generate economic and social activities, promote cross-border trade, and integrate economies within the ECOWAS community. 
It is being implemented by the ECOWAS Commission at an estimated cost of $15 billion. 
Dr Bawumia said the Government of Ghana placed a high premium on the development of roads in the country as they were key to its socioeconomic development. 
“It is for this reason that for the past seven years, the Government, under the leadership of Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, has invested a lot in road construction and the results are visible throughout the country,” he said. 
The Vice President said, the Abidjan-Lagos Corridor Highway Project was, therefore, on the priority list of the Government, and was keen on its commencement. 
“This road is key in realising the full benefits of the African Continental Free Trade Area. The integration of the rail infrastructure and industrial zones along the corridor will help the sub-region achieve the full potential of this highway project,” he added. 
Dr Bawumia assured all of the Government’s commitment to the successful implementation of the project. 
Mr Babatunde Fashola SAN, the Steering Committee Chairman of the Project, explained that the change in political leadership over the years had hindered the delivery of the project. 
Despite this and other challenges, he said, progress had been made and very soon the project would start. 
“All the people I met when I took over as chairman in 2016 have all changed. Our Commissioner for Infrastructure has changed, and ministers have changed. Some of the heads of state who started this project have also changed. Do you know why? Democracy is thriving in our region, people are participating in the Government and they are making choices, and those choices have consequences. 
“And some of the consequences are that political actors will change but, our commitment to this project does not change. We will deliver it,” he indicated. 
Mr Kwasi Amoako-Attah, Minister of Roads and Highways, indicated that detailed engineering studies were almost complete, adding that “we are preparing the ground for the long-awaited implementation phase.” 
Ghana, he said, had embarked on sensitisation of communities along the proposed alignment for the highway project, to ensure a smooth take-off in 2024 as proposed. 
He, therefore, emphasised the need for the committee to quickly assess the cost of compensation, and make funds available to secure the Right of Way as quickly as possible.  
Mr Mike Sawalou, Director, Infrastructure and Urban Development at the African Development Bank, one of the development partners, assured that it was fully committed to making the project a reality.
