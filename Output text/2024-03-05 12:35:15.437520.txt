JERUSALEM (AP): Israeli protesters blocked highways and gathered outside Tel Aviv’s stock exchange and military headquarters on Tuesday in the latest countrywide demonstration against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s planned judicial overhaul.
The latest “day of disruption” came as longtime allies of the prime minister pushed a contentious piece of legislation through a parliamentary committee ahead of a vote expected next week.
Demonstrators, many of them military reservists, created human chains and blocked one of the entrances to the Kirya, Israel’s military headquarters in central Tel Aviv. 
Outside the Tel Aviv stock exchange, demonstrators ignited smoke bombs, drummed and chanted, and held up signs reading “save our startup nation” and “dictatorship will kill the economy.”
Netanyahu heads the most ultranationalist and religiously conservative government in Israel’s 75-year history.
He proposed a series of drastic changes to the country’s judiciary shortly after taking office in December. His government took office in the aftermath of the country’s fifth elections in under four years, all of them regarded as referendums on his fitness to serve as prime minister while on trial for corruption.

                                                                                    -  
The United Nations has said it is ready to take action on the issue of violence against women and girls in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). But the reopening of the roads lasted less than 24 hours, the provincial capital of North Kivu said on Thursday.
"The movement of goods and merchandise is now authorised" on a series of roads controlled by the M23, Lieutenant-Colonel Guillaume Ndjike, spokesman for the provincial governor, announced in a statement on Wednesday evening. Shortly after this announcement, a first convoy returned to Goma without major incident.
The measure has been "suspended until further notice", the governorate said in a new statement late on Thursday, claiming that the rebels had just "killed a driver" and "looted all the goods".
Since late October 2022, the M23 has seized large swathes of North Kivu, cutting off traffic on the province's main roads.
"I have just arrived (in Goma) after enormous suffering. We stayed there for two months, sleeping under the vehicles," Zawadi Kavira, a passenger stranded in Mweso, on the other side of the front lines, about 100km north of Goma, told AFP on Thursday.
Like her, dozens of transporters and passengers coming from the north found themselves blocked by the clashes. "When we arrived in Mweso, we were blocked because of the fighting in Kitshanga," said one driver.
This town of about 60,000 inhabitants came under rebel control on 26 January. Since then, the M23 has been advancing and continuing to tighten its grip on Goma, a city of more than a million inhabitants, wedged between the Rwandan border to the east, Lake Kivu to the south and the rebels to the north and west.
On 28 February, a group of deputies from North Kivu and the provincial representative of the Fédération des entreprises du congo (FEC), in two separate letters, asked the governor and the president of the Republic to reopen the roads in order to "allow the evacuation of foodstuffs to the town of Goma", the FEC said.
The governor had responded positively to their request "in the interest of the population, which is suffering from the effects of the war", before reversing his decision the following day.
The M23 (for "Movement of 23 March") is a rebellion with a Tutsi majority that remained dormant for nearly ten years and reappeared at the end of 2021. Kinshasa accuses Rwanda of supporting it, which has been corroborated by UN experts.

                                                      Launch of works to build Madagascar's first motorway
                                                                                    -  
Authorities in Madagascar have started works on the country's first motorway linking the capital, Antananarivo, to Tamatave, the country's economic hub and largest port.
Egyptian company Samcrete will be in charge of the 4-year project for a budget of nearly $1 billion.
"The highway will allow us to relieve the congestion of the national road number 2 because in fact it is estimated that the traffic will be multiplied by 5 in the next three years. So it will be unbearable for the national road number 2 to handle this extra traffic", said Public Works Minister of Madagascar, Jerry Hatrefindrazana.
The project has sparked controversy amongst the population. Farmers are one group particularly affected.
"We are in the middle of the rice transplanting period, right at the moment when our rice fields will be destroyed. And we have been waiting for the state to take action for us farmers. In all the speeches, no official spoke about the farmers", complained farmer Roland Edie Rakotodramasy.
Others, like teacher Pauline Ramialisoa, remain convinced about the overall benefits.
"Traffic will be faster, cars will not use much gasoline, and the transport of goods from inside and outside will be more fluid", she said
One of the Egyptian companies involved in the project, EGAAD, stressed the environmental advantages of the new infrastructure.
"This highway that will link the capital to the main port, the economic hub of the country, will ease a lot of things, reducing an 11-hour journey to a 2.5-hour journey. It will help to reduce CO2 emissions by 25 to 30%", claims EGAAD group president, Reda Boulos.
The first stage of the project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the president's mandate in 2023.

A new Chinese-built expressway in the Kenyan capital Nairobi will help boost the economy of the African nation, Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for transportation and infrastructure, James Wainaina Macharia, said on Saturday.
The expressway opened to traffic for trial runs on Saturday and is expected to increase local employment, ease traffic jams, and bring a raft of economic benefits to the notoriously congested city.
Macharia hailed the expressway as one of the 'best pieces of infrastructure' ever built on the African continent.
"This road will have a very, very big impact in terms of mobility of Kenyans, visitors, businessmen, businesswomen, tourists. This is one of the best pieces of infrastructure ever done in Africa. In fact, it’s the longest expressway in Africa. So we are very proud today (Saturday) to come to witness the start of the trial run and monitor to make sure that indeed the expressway will be operated seamlessly and to a very high standard," he said.
The expressway stretches 27 kilometres through the heart of Nairobi, connecting Jomo Kenyatta International Airport to Nairobi's Central Business District, the National Museum and the Presidential Palace.
More than 10,000 people have already registered to use the expressway, with an average of 800 people registering every day.
"Definitely, I will use it often. It's convenient, and hopefully, it will remain like that for the rest of its lifetime," said one Nairobi motorist.
The expressway is already creating direct employment opportunities for Nairobi's workers, with employees at the state-of-the-art expressway monitoring centre welcoming the opportunity to learn new technologies and software that keep the road running smoothly.
"We are doing the traffic monitoring and coping with the automatic detection system. We are able to detect if there is any congestion in the expressway if there is any pedestrian crossing if there is any vehicle reversing in the expressway. And thus, we are able to reach out to the responsible department to handle the abnormality on the expressway. We provide our country with a very smart, smooth and safe and speedy travel experience. We are able to learn a lot of software here as we learnt about the software which enables the cameras. Also, in the monitoring centre, I've learnt some Chinese words," said Martha, an employee working at the expressway monitoring centre.
The 73.5 billion shillings (about $648 million) road is expected to cut travel time from the south to the west of Nairobi to about 20 minutes from two hours currently during peak time.
The expressway was financed and built by China Road and Bridge Corporation under a public-private partnership model. Full-scale construction of the infrastructure project began in September 2020 and was completed a year ahead of schedule.
Building the expressway created more than 6,000 direct jobs, benefiting 200 sub-contractors and hundreds of other local suppliers of building materials such as steel, sand, cement and ballast.

Algeria partners China for construction of 6,000km railway lines 
                                                      Railway line
                                                                                    -  
China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the "best guarantee of development", stressing that "our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km." The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
"China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner," said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
"The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth," he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
"As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities," said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
"This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone," echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

It's a road that will link six African nations, improving transport and delivering high-speed internet across the continent. And at In Guezzam, on the border between Algeria and Niger, the last section of what's been called the African Unity Road is nearing completion.
Conceived over 50 years ago, the Trans-Saharan Highway runs almost 5,000 kilometres from Algiers to Lagos in Nigeria. Its goal is to strengthen regional integration and promote trade between the north and south of the Sahara.
An artery for Algeria"The Trans-Saharan is an economic artery for Algeria in the framework of free trade," says Fayçal Amrouche, Wali of In-Guezzam. "First and foremost it will bring economic benefits and also social benefits for the whole population, which is expecting a lot from it.
"Overall, the residents of In-Guezzam are pleased with this seven-kilometre stretch of road, which is the last section of the African Unity Road on the border with Niger," adds Brahim Ben Khia, President of the Popular Assembly in the Wilaya of In-Guezzam. "It's a construction that's built to international standards."
The RN1 is the main artery between Europe and North Africa. Without the RN1, we're done for!
From Saharan dunes to high plateaus to the capital Algiers, National Road 1, as it's known in Algeria, crosses the country in all its diversity and links remote areas, such as Tamanrasset, the historic meeting place of nomadic caravans, and still a commercial hub, 1900 kilometres from Algiers.
"The Wilaya of Tamanrasset is a crossroads of all African civilisations," says Noureddine Guellal, Director Of Public Works and Wilaya of Tamanrasset. "Barter transactions have increased in recent years. The list of products to be exported and imported is revised each year according to our needs and those of our neighbours."
To cope with this influx, existing sections are being modernised. Following technical studies which took into account the difficult Saharan conditions, their load capacity and width are being increased to ensure safe passage for trucks.
"The RN1 is the main artery between Europe and North Africa," says truck driver Louzri Abderrezak. "Without the RN1, we're done for!"

Internet Cable BackboneBut it's not just roads that connect people. There's also the internet. This road is lined with thousands of kilometres of cable as part of another multinational project: the Trans-Saharan Fibre Optic Backbone.
These technical centres maintain the bandwidth, which has almost doubled over the past two years.
"These are the incoming fibre strands of the trans-Saharan backbone," Bilel Bouglouf, Director Of Post And Telecommunications in the Wilaya Of Tamanrasset, show me. "Their exit towards the borders is through here. Thanks to this trans-Saharan fibre optic backbone, there's the same internet speed in Algiers as in Tamanrasset."
The arrival of fibre optics has enabled the creation of digital schools. This has had a huge impact on pupils' education.
                        Director, Abdelkrim El Meghili Primary Boarding School
The Internet is changing daily life in this large southern city. Credit cards are becoming more widely used in shops. In schools, touch-screen tablets are given to students to encourage creativity and autonomy.
"The arrival of fibre optics has enabled the creation of digital schools," says Ibtissem Merahi, Director of the Abdelkrim El Meghili Primary Boarding School. "This has had a huge impact on pupils' education."
Algeria has completed its part of the fibre optic backbone, more than 2,500 kilometres from Algiers towards Mauritania to a central hub on the border with Niger.
Six African countries are members of the project, which is intended to offer a cheaper alternative to satellite solutions.
"This project will also enable access to the international market for countries that have no coastline, no access to the sea and no submarine cable," says Mourad El-Allia Secretary General Trans-Saharan Liaison Committee. "It allows start-ups and innovation to emerge, and also allows women to showcase their work. It also enables distance learning. It allows us to contribute to the digital development of our African nations."
Another major cooperation project could see the light of day on the same axis: a trans-Saharan gas pipeline between Nigeria and Algeria via Niger.

Kenya: Sand harvestings' dire impact on rivers and aquatic life 
                                                      Sand excavators in Kenya
                                                                                    -  
It's hard to believe that a river flowed through this land in Kenya's Machakos County.
It's just over a hundred miles from the capital Nairobi with its demands as a growing city.
Construction, the need to make glass, cement, concrete and a host of everyday items is what leads the workers and their lorries here.
But the constant excavation of sand n is threatening the environment.
These teams of sand excavators say they are aware of the problem, but there is no system to help them manage the harvesting sustainably.
He says he and others have seen the devastation caused by uncontrolled sand harvesting.
"For our sand, sometimes we excavate to the detriment of our grazing areas, leading to our animals lacking water, but if the government can construct sand catchments so that we can have watering and grazing areas, put regulations where we are supposed to pass while carrying sand and restrict others and construct good roads, it will be a good move," says Mutisya.
"The sand carried from these rivers in a day is in hundreds and thousands of tons because an average semi-trailer can carry 50 tons, (but) there are those for 30 tons and one like mine which is 15 tons. So in a day, it's hard to know the exact (amount) but it's thousands of tons," he adds.
Halinish Yusuf is the Sand Conservation and Utilization Director at Makueni County.
She believes there is a clear need to regulate the industry and to carry out studies to discover whether the resources they have in terms of sand can meet the growing demands.
"Because of the strategic importance of sand being the second most extracted natural resource after water and the importance because of the modernization that is going on, demand from the construction industry, demand from the glass industry and many other industries, there is a need to start thinking about regulating it, recycling, regulating where its harvested, how its harvested, but also thinking about alternatives and also thinking about upscaling and monitoring how its harvested, where, the amounts we have so that we start planning for the future," says Yusuf.
In Kiambu County, a new construction site requires more building materials.
The groundbreaking ceremony to mark a new housing project is cause for celebration, but it could have detrimental consequences for the environment from which the sand is being excavated.
Many rivers in this part of Kenya are bare, and only huge protruding rocks remain.
Lorries excavating sand runs on almost a 24-hour cycle to supply building sites like this one in Kiambu.
Site engineer Samuel Waweru of Vimika Construction has to turn this 20-acre site into a block of residential apartments in the next 18 months.
He argues the regulation of sand supply is a government issue, but he says his crews will also be able to use the rocks to make the necessary building materials.
"About the river sand we don't have data on how much sand is being used but it is in huge figures in terms of millions of tons. In the future because of the environment, we have seen some counties prohibit sand harvesting but in case of sand is prohibited, we have an alternative where we can use rock sand. Rock sand we get it from the ballast, when we are crushing the ballast the byproduct is rock sand which is recommended to use as a substitute for river sand," he says.
According to a recent report by the United Nations Environment Programe (UNEP) sand is the second-largest exploited resource after water.
It says globally, 50 billion tons of sand and gravel are harvested every year.
The conservation group WWF says: "sand mining is already putting unprecedented pressure on rivers, floodplains and deltas," leading to erosion, biodiversity loss and reduced protection from storm surges.
Many communities in Kenya depend on this sort of excavation as their only source of income and as a consequence in some regions, uncontrolled harvesting has led to environmental damage which has been largely overlooked.
According to Yusuf, there needs to be an inventory to understand how much sand is left, what damage has been done and what the demands of the industry will be in the coming years.
She says: "Unfortunately, there is no data to show how much sand is going to be demanded in future development, and by the same token there is hardly any research on the amount of sand deposits that we have. And so, there is, even as we make plans, development plans as governments, we are not able to tell how much sand will be required and if we are running into a crisis or not and so, there is a need to invest in research, to know how much sand deposits we have, how much can be harvested, and how much is needed for development."
Mutisya is aware that his livelihood is already going to have an impact on the supply of water to his family because as the sand disappears and the ground heads underground water supplies are depleted.
He says: "We are saying if the government puts in structures, we will be ready to comply with those restrictions because in doing so we will conserve water for our livestock and even for our own consumption, so that there is a restricted area so that we can conserve the water because we are headed to a very dry season where we will be forced to buy water, even for our livestock."

The people of Kinshasa cannot believe the speed at which a Turkish company has built an imposing financial complex in the heart of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, more accustomed to major Chinese projects than to these new builders of the African continent.
“It’s changed suddenly,” notes a street vendor with a laugh, who has been forced for a little over a year to move his goods as the perimeter of the construction site changes. “They work day and night, even faster than the Chinese,” adds a security agent, somewhat admiringly.
In February 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an official visit to the DRC, his umpteenth trip to Africa. Under his leadership, Ankara has invested a lot in the continent over the past two decades, to develop diplomatic but also economic ties.
Turkish companies have, for example, built a mosque in Ghana, stadiums in Rwanda or Senegal, and airports in several countries.
In Kinshasa, he concluded cooperation agreements concerning in particular security, defense and the construction of infrastructure, including the "Finance Center" whose work was quickly launched, in a concession located near the Turkish school, in the business commune of Gombe.
There was at this place, between the courthouse and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a roundabout pompously called Place de l'Independance, decorated with a sort of faded cement platform carried by stairs leading to no monument.
Visitors sometimes walked there, between the rows of plants in small bags bought by the occupants of the villas with gardens built in the area during the time of the Belgian settlers. Then the palisades and construction bungalows appeared, quickly dominated by half a dozen concrete towers gradually covered with glass panels.
Two of them, around twenty floors high, will house the Ministries of Finance and Budget. The complex, which includes nine buildings in total, will also house a convention center, offices, a large hotel, etc.
The prime contractor is the company Milvest, a subsidiary of the Turkish holding company Miller. According to its CEO Turhan Mildon, who gave a press briefing on the site in mid-September, this project will have employed some 3,000 people - 1,800 Congolese and 1,200 Turks.
The cost of the work is estimated at $290 million, pre-financed by the company, which is also investing $60 million in the hotel which it will manage for 49 years. The finance center is scheduled to be inaugurated on December 2. Before the elections scheduled for the 20th of the same month, in which the current president Félix Tshisekedi is a candidate for a second term.
With its dusty scaffolding, the construction site very close to the new Chinese embassy seems almost to be stalling, and the Chinese workers no longer have the attraction of novelty among the Congolese.
Very present in the country since the time of Mobutu Sese Seko (1965-97), they built the "People's Palace" , the seat of Parliament, and the Martyrs Stadium, an immense enclosure with 80,000 seats.
Under Joseph Kabila (2001-2019), under the terms of a mega-contract "mines for infrastructure", they rebuilt and enlarged large avenues, including the boulevard du 30 Juin, which looks like a highway in the middle of the city.

If it is dark at the Mfusis it's because of power cuts. The South African family of five now has to enter power cut mode; meaning: rely on battery torches and candles.
The state-owned power utility is implementing scheduled blackouts. and sometimes gives just a few hours notice. Life has become a rush for the Soweto residents.
"We would come back from school, work and then just, you know, catch up as a family, do...prepare supper, help with homework", Duduzile Mfusi, the mother of three explains. 
"But now have to rush everything. What takes priority is your homework and making sure that everybody eats on time before it gets dark. So, we try to at least make sure that by the time load shedding (power outage) hits, everything is done", she adds.
The Mfusis invested in a generator when power outages only lasted for an hour or two during stage one earlier this year. However, running the generator has become too costly.
"Not having electricity for a period of about 4 hours to 6 hours in a day, it's extremely costly because the generator, also, it's not it's not effective for us in terms of finances", Nhlanhla Mfusi, the father, laments. 
"It's extremely expensive because now you're buying petrol for the generator, you're buying petrol for your car because we have to transport the kids back and forth, back and forth. So we can't afford the generator anymore.''
The public power utility, Eskom, produces 95% of the country’s electricity but struggles to to keep its ageing and poorly maintained coal-fired power stations operational.
As a matter of consequence, supply street furniture like traffic lights, public services including water supply, businesses and households are going without electricity for up to eight hours a day.
To all of them, Eskom asks to use electricity sparingly in order to help prevent nationwide blackouts. 
Bad strategyEconomist Jannie Rossouw, thinks the strategy isn't the good one: "Eskom treats its consumers as if they are the enemies. The sense is as if Eskom is shouting at people: 'You use too much electricity, you're in the wrong.'"
"Eskom should again establish its credibility in civil society with the general public so that civil society and the general public can help support Eskom in its engagement with government to help Eskom overcome the limitations on electricity supply that government has put on Eskom", the economist concludes.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa this week cancelled his trip to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly and returned home after the funeral of the Queen Elizabeth II to chair a meeting with his ministers.
According to the official national statistics agency StatsSA, power cuts -referred to by Eskom as load-shedding- were a crucial contributor to the economy contracting by 0.7% in the second quarter of 2022.
Indeed, just about every sector is hurt, and South Africa's biggest telecommunication companies this week warned that continuous blackouts may start affecting their services.
In July, Cyril Ramaphosa announced energy reforms, urging South Africans to "join in a massive rollout of rooftop solar" and sell the excess to the grid. 
He then announced the government, would use climate funding provided through the Just Energy Transition Partnership to invest in the grid and repurpose power stations that have reached the end of their lives.
Last year, the South African authorities raised the licensing threshold for new embedded generation projects from 1 MW to 100 MW.

At least five people were missing Wednesday in the centre of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) the day after the collapse of a bridge which gave way to the passage of a truck, we learned from concordant sources.
According to witnesses, the Lovua bridge, over the river of the same name, gave way when the truck, too heavily laden with construction materials, crossed it on its way to Tshikapa, the capital of Kasai province.
"The truck had ten people on board. One of them refused to cross on board this machine but the others were stubborn", explained the head of the sector where the accident occurred, Hubert Mbombo.
According to him, the truck with its nine occupants, as well as the bridge, which had been badly damaged for several years, fell into the river. The bodies of the victims have not been found.
Guy Mafuta, MP for Kasaï, meanwhile put the number of missing at seven and the vice-governor, Gaston Nkole, at five – two men, a woman and two children. According to Mr Nkole, interviewed by AFP, the vehicle was carrying some 30 tons of cement and stones, while the bridge was designed to support 10 to 15 tons.
The collapse of road bridges, in poor condition and used by heavy loads are frequent in the DRC, especially during the rainy season.

A truck crashed into several passenger vehicles in the Mediterranean province of Alexandria, Egypt, killing at least 15 people, the authorities announced on Wednesday.
The accident, which occurred late on Tuesday in the district of Amreya, west of the city of Alexandria, also injured eight people, according to a police report.
The truck crashed into four microbuses, a type of public transport minibus widely used in Egypt, according to the report. One microbus overturned and a second was set on fire.
Ambulances rushed to the scene of the accident and transported the injured to hospitals, according to local media.
Road accidents claim thousands of victims every year in Egypt, where transport safety leaves much to be desired. Accidents and collisions are often caused by speeding, poor road conditions or poor enforcement of traffic regulations.
In October, a passenger bus collided head-on with a parked vehicle on a motorway linking Alexandria to the capital Cairo, killing at least 32 people.

A passenger bus slammed into a parked truck on a highway in the Sudanese city of Omdurman early on Tuesday, killing at least 16 people, police said.
The bus swerved off the road and hit a parked truck in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital, Khartoum, according to a police statement. At least 19 people were injured in the accident, police said.
The bus was heading to Khartoum from Fasher, the provincial capital of North Darfur province, police said. Ambulances rushed to the scene to transfer the injured to the Omdurman hospital, while the dead were taken to the morgue.
There was no immediate word as to what caused the bus to swerve.
Traffic accidents are common in Sudan, often the result of badly maintained roads and poor enforcement of traffic laws. Thousands of people are killed every year in road accidents.

Somalia: President vows son will answer for fatal highway crash in Istanbul
                                                      Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud speaks during a meeting with US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon in Washington, DC, on June 21, 2023.
                                                                                    -  
**Somalia’s president says his son didn’t flee Turkey after he was involved in a fatal highway crash in Istanbul.**He has advised his son to go back and present himself to court, which has issued an arrest warrant.
President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud said in an interview with The Associated Press that his 40-year-old son, who is a doctor, stayed at the scene of the crash and remained in Istanbul for several days afterward.
“It was an accident. He did not run away, and he hired a lawyer for this purpose,” the president said.
“And there was no arrest warrant. … So, he has a business and he came out of the country."
The victim, Yunus Emre Gocer, a 38-year-old motorcycle courier, died in a hospital Dec. 6, six days after he was hit by a car driven by the president’s son, Mohammed Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, on a busy highway in Istanbul.
Turkish authorities ordered president's son arrested and barred him from traveling abroad following the motorcyclist’s death, but reports said the younger Mohamud had already left Turkey by the time the warrant was issued.
“He still is linked to the country, and I am talking to him to go back and presenting himself to the court," the president said.
But his son is an adult and “the decision is his — but I am giving that advice,” he said.
“I want to take this opportunity to send my condolences to the family, which I don’t know how to contact," he said.
"We share with them the grief of their loss. We are sorry for their loss.”
Dozens of people staged a demonstration in Istanbul on Sunday demanding that the son face trial for Gocer’s death.
Responding to the pressure, Turkish Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc tweeted Sunday that, “Regardless of their title, everyone is equal before the law and the entire process for the capture of the suspect — including the international procedure — is being carried out meticulously.”
Turkey has built close ties with Somalia since 2011, when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, then prime minister, visited the East African nation in a show of support as Somalis suffered from severe drought.
“I will do everything that I can to make sure that my son respects Turkish law and justice law, and stands in front of the courts in Turkey," Somalia's president said.
“We respect the laws and the justice and the judicial system. As a president of Somalia, I will never allow anybody to violate this country’s judicial system.”

DR Congo: M23 rebels tighten economic vice around eastern North Kivu province
                                                      Bus on the RN2 highway, which leads to Goma from the north, eastern DRC
                                                                                    -  
M23 rebels have cut major supply routes to Goma, eastern DR Congo, sending prices in the city surging and sparking fears that a future offensive will cripple its economy.
A Tutsi-led group that lay dormant for years, the M23 took up arms again late last year, seizing swaths of territory in North Kivu province.
Last month, the rebels came within several dozen kilometres of Goma, a commercial hub of over one million people, on the border with Rwanda.
Their advance has cut off the RN2 highway, which leads to Goma from the north, and with it access to farm produce from North Kivu's Rutshuru region.
Goods from nearby Uganda also provisioned Goma from the RN2, before the conflict erupted.
Charcoal trader Pascaline Kahongya, 40, said prices had recently soared for the fuel commonly used to cook in the impoverished Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
"When you tell people the price, they go home," said Kahongya, sheltering from the rain in her storeroom in a Goma market.
Charcoal sourced from Rutshuru must now take a long road through militia-riddled areas to reach Goma from the west.
"The kids aren't going to school at the moment, we can't pay the fees," said Kahongya, a mother of eight.
Boats can also reach Goma from Bukavu, a city on the other side of Lake Kivu. And goods can still enter from Rwanda.
But inside the DRC, only the road leading to the city from the west remains viable, slashing trade volumes and driving up prices.
Some fear M23 rebels plan to block this artery too in order to exert pressure on the government.
Onesphore Sematumba, a DRC analyst for the International Crisis Group (ICG), said the rebels aim to sweep into Masisi territory -- west of Goma -- to this end.
"If we can't negotiate a humanitarian corridor for the city, it will be a catastrophe," he said.
The M23 first leapt to prominence ago when it captured Goma in 2012, before being driven out and going to ground.
It re-emerged late last year, claiming the DRC had failed to honour a pledge to integrate its fighters into the army, among other grievances.
In June, the rebels seized Bunagana, a strategic town on the border with Uganda. After a period of calm, the rebels went on the offensive again in October, forcing hundreds of thousands to flee.
Lieutenant-Colonel Guillaume Ndjike, the DRC's army spokesman in North Kivu, also said the M23 planned to strangle Goma.
The military were making sure Goma "was not totally asphyxiated," he added, explaining that it was "inconceivable" the army would let goods pass through the RN2, for security reasons.
The DRC accuses its smaller central African neighbour Rwanda of backing the rebels, something US officials and United Nations experts agree with, but which is strongly denied by Kigali.
Prices for basic items such as soap surged 20 percent in some Goma markets between October and November, according to a food security group led by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP).
Several people interviewed by AFP also said the cost of a cup of beans had tripled from the equivalent of about $0.5 to $1.5.
About 70 percent of Congolese survive on under $2 a day, according to the World Bank.
Sitting in front of buckets of soya and sorghum flour in a nearly empty Goma market, Adela Lubala said clients had disappeared.
Her small business survived the pandemic and the 2021 eruption of the Mount Nyiragongo volcano, which looms over Goma.
But the current crisis is the worst yet, Lubala said, adding that five of her nine children are no longer studying due to lack of money.
"What you see here is our old stock," said the 53-year-old, gesturing to her wares. "When we run out, there's no where else to buy."
Claudia Ngowa, 36, said she had had to shutter her small soap factory and furlough four employees because she imported raw materials from Uganda along the RN2.
The entrepreneur also owns a farm in Masisi, but said rampant insecurity makes it difficult to transport goods despite the road remaining untouched by the M23.
"We can't go on without selling," she said. "It's really precarious for everyone."

Nigeria: At least 12 killed in petrol tanker explosion in northcentral Kogi 
                                                      Petrol tanker explosion Kogi state Nigeria
                                                                                    -  
At least 12 people were killed when a gasoline tanker crashed on a major road and then exploded in Nigeria’s northcentral Kogi State, police said Friday.
The tanker had a brake failure along a major road in the Ofu council area on Thursday night when it collided with a vehicle obstructing the highway, causing a fireball, a police spokesman told The Associated Press.
The vehicle “crushed cars on the way” and “12 people were killed” - all burnt to death, said William Ovye Aya with the Kogi police command.
Bisi Kazeem with Nigeria’s Federal Road Safety Corps said 18 people were involved in the crash. Seven sustained “various degrees of injuries while the remaining 11 were burnt beyond recognition” at the scene, Kazeem said in a statement.
The road has been cordoned off and road safety workers are working to identify the victims, Kazeem said.
Such crashes are common along most major roads in Nigeria, with new measures introduced by the country’s road safety corps failing to curb their occurrence. Kogi is a known hot spot with more than 10 people killed in a similar crash in September.
