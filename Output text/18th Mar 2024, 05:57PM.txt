The development forum and development and construction of the P’ynang gas project in the Western Province will come after the completion of the construction phase of the Papua LNG project.
Minister for Petroleum Kerenga Kua said while responding to questions without notice from Western Governor Taboi Awi Yoto who wanted to know when the development forum for the landowners, the provincial government, the affected LLG and the State will be conducted.
The Governor also wanted to know when the State would pass the P’ynang Gas Fiscal Stability Act to give the provincial government and the affected district development authority (DDA) access to the tune of K150 million as tax credit fund as captured in the gas agreement.
Mr Kua in his response said there are two similar projects within the same region, the Elk Antelope in Gulf and the Pynang in the Western Province, and they share the same geographical region.
Therefore, the government has sequenced the two projects, by firstly starting off with the development and the construction of the Papuan LNG project hopefully by 2024 and then move over to Pýnang, running back to back within the space of 4 years.
This means that the Development Forum for Pynanag will take place in 2027 and the construction and the development would start in 2028.
Mr Kua said this sequencing is basically to run parallel simultaneously, and that is due to the fact that the country is small with a small public service, and they cannot be engaged in two similar projects at once, as technically skilled fields like these requires a lot of work.
He said the State need not only the public servants but the skilled private sector contractors in such big projects and with a small workforce, they cannot be engaged in two major highly skilled projects concurrently.
The Minister said the other reason is for the greater benefit of the country’s economy, and that is to expand the economic benefits so the economy is sustained for a longer period and not to run concurrently and collapse the economy.

The Edevu hydro power station construction is on schedule, with all work to be completed by the end of September, 2023.
The Edevu power project, opened in April this year, will supply 54 megawatts into the Port Moresby grid with 2x turbines each producing 27 megawatts.
The current peak loan demand in Port Moresby grid is 132 megawatts.
PNG Power chairman McRonald Nale said Edevu’s bigger sized generating units with higher inertia will add stability to the Port Moresby grid.
“With Edevu, Port Moresby grid will have an improved ability to withstand electrical shocks and disturbances, thereby reducing network blackouts. 
Having high inertia machines from Edevu will significantly reduce total system outages caused by network cascading effects. 
Edevu hydro power brings clean, fuel free and low-cost power to supply increasing demand in the Port Moresby grid,” Mr Nale said.
PPL estimates about 40 to 50 megawatts are produced and utilised by large industries off grid due to reliability issues.
“With low cost power from Edevu hydro, this will improve network regulation and improved attention to our customers through a range of initiatives, including Amnesty Program and Feeder Team Management, we believe the industries not on the PPL grid will reconnect,” Mr Nale said.
PNG Hydro Development Ltd managing director Allan Guo said the total towers of the main transmission lines to be built from Edevu to the Moitaka is 104.
“Work on erecting and stringing of towers is completed from tower 1- tower 39. From tower 39 — 89, erection of towers completed without stringing. 
This week, our contractors will be working on towers 90 — 95, that is doing the foundation work and so forth,” Mr Guo said.
By the end of September, PNG Power will officially do the technical commissioning for the Edevu Hydro Power Station, and will run on full operation for three days, before final tests are done and the official commissioning takes place.

It was a first of its kind in the history of the Telefomin people to access a new road.This new road from Tabubil, Western province connecting the first village, Urapmin in Telefomin district of West Sepik province was launched last Friday.The Urapmin villagers including nearby villages in the district and North Fly people, Tabubil and Kiunga turned out in numbers to witness the launching ceremony.Urapmin ward president Siniki Babeloki said it is a new beginning for them.“We have over 700 people in this village and we are so happy.“We walk for three days and nights to reach Tabubil.“We carry store goods, iron sheets, teaching materials and other things from Tabubil and walk back through the cold, foggy and rugged mountainous terrain to reach Telefomin.“Some of our people have died along this bush tracks.” he said.Mr Babeloki said seeing the machinery and trucks in the village is a joyous experience as the construction of the road means they can now reach Tabubil by truck and return home the same day.Telefomin district administrator Joshua Himina said the lack of road has been a major hindrance for delivery of services.However, this road will enable them to see more changes in the district.“New roads linking nearby villages will be done, health centres, schools and other services as well. All of these services are captured in our five -year development plan,” he said.It took six years since 2018 to construct road connecting Western and West Sepik provinces.Other eight kilometres of road construction from Urapmin village to Telefomin station will continue this month and further road construction will continue to Oksapmin rural LLG starting this year.The engineers from the contractor Ipwenz Construction Limited (IPZ), other sub- contractors with support from Ok Tedi Mine through the tax credit scheme under the Connect PNG program have helped established the road.Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, Minister for Works and Highways and Telefomin MP Solan Mirisim, Labour Minister and Rai Coast MP Kessy Sawang, Hela Governor Philip Undialu, OTML managing director Kedi Ilimbit and other dignitaries witnessed the event last Friday.

Jimi MP Wake Goi is determined to see the first 15 kilometres of road from the border of Jimi and North Waghi to Wara Molu bridge is sealed.
He wants to see the sealing extended to Karap Junction in middle Jimi during this term of parliament.
Mr Goi said roads and bridges are two priority programs that will be undertaken by Jimi District Development Authority among other projects.
He said one of the major road constructions will be done between Kol local level government (LLG) and Ambullua.
“This road is non-existent and I plan to launch the Jimi DDA earthmoving equipment next month to start the project.
“More than 20,000 people of Ambullua will soon have access to this very vital road infrastructure,” Mr Goi said.
He said the people living in this part of the remote district will for the first time have access to the outside world.

Prime Minister James Marape has launched the five-year development plan for Gumine district, Chimbu Province.
Sinasina-Yonggomugl MP Kerenga Kua, Education Minister Jimmy Uguro and the department’s Secretary Dr Uke Kombra accompanied Mr Marape to the occasion last Thursday.
Joining MP Lucas Dekena to receive the entourage were Simbu Governor Noah Kool with the provincial administrator John Punde and Kerowagi MP Francis Siune and some educated elites of Chimbu.
Mr Dekena said there are many areas needing attention and took time to name some for the projects. These include:
10 per cent of Gumine district budget to church infrastructure work on the basis of Mathew 6:33 and Proverbs 6:3 and 16:12 that call on the people to seek God first in everything we do for wisdom, direction and guidance for wise use of limited resources for greater benefits against unlimited demands and desires.
NID registration not only for voting but also for effective planning of socio-economic developments, whose work is already on foot in the district.
Restoration of district administrative authority to ensure public servants are in the district to deliver in their respective sections.
Roads as the key enablers of other services to flow into the district, with the upgrade to the existing ring roads and construction of new ones to unlinked areas and the sealing of the district road from where it was stopped.
Rising the education performance standard through discipline.
He said the biggest challenge to implementation of this plan for around 62,000 people in the three local level government areas spread across 708km2 of landmass is the free-hand-out mentality.
Mr Dekena said plan is important to keep focus on the development aspiration and urged everyone to work together.
“The Gumine district spending will be as per the budget in line with the development plan,” he said.
“Do not come in with proposals that are not within the plan and get upset when we refuse your proposal.”
Mr Kua commended the Gumine DDA for the plan after being without it for years.“As your local MP, he (Mr Dekena) knows the current state of the district and the way forward,” he said.
Mr Marape accepted the plan on behalf of the Minister for Finance and National Planning and Monitoring Minister Rainbo Paita, saying it is in line with the Medium-Term Development Plan 4.
Governor Mr Kool committed the Simbu Provincial Government to all the districts in the province.
He presented K5 million continue on with the district’s rural electrification project, which has not progressed for years from where it stopped.
“We have already deposited K5 million into the district account,” Mr Marape said before he left for a meeting in Lae regarding Wafi-Golpu gold mine.

A THIRTY-six kilometre Ring Road Project in the Rigo North LLG of Rigo District in Central Province has been completed by Koia Investment Company Limited.
The Ring Road will now serve 20 council wards of North Rigo LLG who have been suffering from lack of better road access for the last 27 years. The Ring Road project was funded by the Central Provincial Government under the works program.
Present during the completion of the road last Sunday (27th August) were ), respective community leaders of Rigo North owner of the construction company Biari Ubuna, Acting Police Station Commander of Kwikila police station, Sergeant Bobby Ogara and a representative from the Rigo district development authority.
A community Leader Murray Gini thanked the constructor and the Central provincial government for providing the needed service to the 17, 000 plus population of Rigo North.
“The 20 council wards in the hinterland of Rigo District gratefully accolade praise to the management of KICL for the construction of Sivitatana – Wiga road connection,” Gini said.
“The road has been cut off for public use for about 27 years ago, which in other words can be put as political negligence for the last 5 terms by the previous governments.
“The Prime Minister James Marape declared the Rigo Inland Ring Road as Yagabo Highway when he was invited at Boregaina Village in late 2020 and he had announced K27 million for the road project.
In proceed to that announcement, this portion of the road was not accounted for and this has led our people to uncertainty of the effectiveness of government commitments.
“The people of Rigo North wish to give special thanks and accord to KICL, our sincere appreciation for the great achievement in bringing the road home to us.”
Biari thanked the leaders and people of Rigo North for working together with the constructor and successfully completed the project.
“The constructor is not here to make money but to deliver the needed service to the people of Rigo North.
Even though the scope of the road project ends at Dilikomana village, yet we have continued further for about 8 kilometres to Matanatou Sub Health Centre to fully connect the Ring Road. 
Biari further acknowledged and thanked the Central provincial government for making the funding available to complete the Ring Road project.

The noise of machines bulldozing and cutting into the thick virgin forest to build the first road into the landlocked and remote Bosavi local level government in the Nipa-Kutubu district is in indeed a 48th Independent Anniversary gift for these people in that part of the country.
Walking and hauling cargo on their backs like camels for days through thick forest and tough rugged terrains from Hidinia village in the Lower Foi in the Kutubu LLG to Mt Bosavi has been the normal practise for the people, when they did not have the money to pay for the expensive airfares from Mt Hagen.
The local MP Dr Billy Joseph has become the saviour of this forgotten people, when he and his district development authority decided to give these forgotten people an early 48 years Independence Anniversary gift.
Reality came to he fore when the first machine started working on the road to give access to the more than 20 000 people.
Thanks to Dr Joseph, the Bosavi road construction started on Monday this week when the first machine started to cut into the thick jungles to open up access.
More than 20 000 people live in this part of the area and despite being isolated, they made headlines recently on the kidnapping incidents.
Dr Joseph said the Nipa-Kutubu District Development Authority (NKDDA) with assitance from the Mt Bosavi LLG and the Kutubu LLG have injected the initial finding of K7million to start the construction of the road with no assistance from the Provincial and National Governments.
“Today is a historic and milestone occasion when the first machine started punching road into the landlocked communities.
“Our people live in poverty and have endured the hardships in life for almost 48 years since Independence with an absence of a road connectivity,” he said.

Projects roll on as Belt and Road Initiative reaches milestone - Post Courier

China’s Belt and Road Initiative has gained momentum since its commencement 10 years ago in 2013.
Initially it had a regional focus but rapidly expanded beyond central Asia towards the Middle East, Africa, South America, Eastern Europe and the Indo Pacific regions, making it the biggest such program since the Marshall Plan after World War II.
Logically, there was a sharp increase in the number of projects, total investments committed and executed, and the number of countries joining as partners. 
The current number of countries and organizations stand at over 150.
China stressed that the BRI was a new model for partnership, trade and integration that was free from hegemonic pressures and conditions. Later the principles of multilateralism, environment and sustainability were embedded in the BRI.
The West, fearing China’s rapid influence through the BRI, came up with competing initiatives such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (G7), the Global Gateway (EU), the Quality Infrastructure Investment Program (Japan), and others, but their ability to rival the BRI in scale is yet to be established.
As PNG joined these 150 other countries and organizations in Beijing this month to review their involvements in the BRI, the Post-Courier takes a brief look at three projects that have been rolled out in PNG under the auspices of the BRI.
The PNG national power grid, which includes a 132kV transmission and substations for Mt Hagen, Mendi, Tari, represents the first collaborative energy infrastructure endeavor between PNG and China under the Belt and Road Initiative.
This project closely aligns with PNG’s national energy strategy, which aims to increase electricity accessibility from the current 15% to 70% by 2030 and ultimately transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
The project is funded by the China Exim Bank and executed by the contractor TBEA Co., Ltd.
The project owner is PNG Power, the project scope consists of the construction of four new 132kV substations (Mt. Hagen, Pauanda, Mendi, and Tari) and a 180-kilometer 132kV transmission line connecting these substations.
Upon completion, it significantly increased the power grid coverage, effectively alleviated energy shortages, and greatly improved grid stability and reliability in the Highlands region.
The project directly benefits residents of the three Highlands provinces (Western Highlands Province, Southern Highlands Province and Hela Province) and provides power to adjacent mining projects, including gold and copper mines.
Consequently, it will efficiently stimulate economic growth in those regions connected by the power grid. 
This initiative can also meet the electricity demands of millions of households and residents, thus improving the quality of life for local communities.
Before 2015, due to the complex geographical environment and insufficient transportation infrastructure, internet access remained relatively expensive in PNG, with only about 12 percent of PNG residents connected to the internet.
There was no backbone network in PNG. The backbone communication network between islands was mainly low-bandwidth and high-cost transmission network such as satellite and microwave. The bandwidth was limited.
New services such as high-speed mobile Internet could not be launched. 
With the development of the local economy, the existed bandwidth could not meet the market requirements.
The PNG National Submarine Cable Network Project (NSCNP) was implemented by PNG DataCo Ltd, a wholesale subsidiary of Kumul Telikom Holdings and a State-owned commercial entity.
This project was one of the high priority projects included in the Framework Agreement on Development Cooperation between China and PNG signed on July 8, 2016. 
The project was financed by EXIM Bank and was completed in June 2020.
This project was a 5457km submarine fiber cable network project connecting 14 major cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang and Lae. 
At the same time, 14 submarine cable landing sites were built in 14 cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang, and Lae, to install submarine cable terminal equipment and network access equipment. 
Two data centers were also built in Port Moresby and Madang, used for supporting the operation of submarine cable services.
Firstly, the project has improved the bandwidth, reliability and stability of PNG’s domestic network.
It helped reduce the internet pricing by introducing competition mechanism;Secondly, the project connects PNG to China through Indonesia. 
The submarine cable has become an important international network channel for the South Pacific island countries;
Thirdly, the project drives the digital economy to help the country’s socio-economic progress and development.
Early in 2000, Fujian Province of China and Eastern Highlands Province of PNG signed a sister province agreement and listed Juncao and upland rice technology as the aiding technology to Eastern Highlands Province by Fujian Province. 
This project was carried out by the team of Prof. Lin Zhanxi from Fujian University of Agriculture and Forestry (FUAF). This project is now in its fourth phase.
In November 2018, during President Xi’s visit to PNG, leaders of the two countries witnessed the signing of the project, the first phase of which started in August 2019 and ended in August 2022. 
In February 2022, the two countries signed the second phase of the project, which will be implemented over a three-year period from September 2022 to August 2025.
The project has overcome the difficulties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, and has overfulfilled the tasks of the project in the fields of training, demonstration, production and extension.
In total, 27 technical training courses have been held, and a total of 2,921 people have been trained; Juncao mushroom, Juncao animal husbandry, and upland rice planting have been promoted to 17 districts in nine provinces, with a total of more than 10,000 farmers and 40,000 people benefiting from the project; and set the world record for highest output of pennisetum giganteum (Juncao grass), which was 8.53 tons per hectare.
Eastern Highlands Province has listed the Juncao and upland rice industries as the second and third major agricultural industries to be developed after the coffee industry.
The project has benefited many farmers in PNG and improved the agricultural skills level of the farmers. 
It became a model of Belt and Road Initiative cooperation between China and PNG, and played a very important role in deepening the development cooperation between the two countries and the sister-province relationship between Fujian and Eastern Highlands provinces.
The project team has provided local farmers with 1,226,700 Juncao mushroom tubes, and more than 1,725 farmers have participated in the cultivating Juncao mushroom.
The farmers mainly produce oyster mushroom and sell the harvested fresh mushroom to supermarkets, local market and supermarkets in Port Moresby.
Zaka Abori, a woman mushroom farmer, started growing mushroom in February 2020 with the help of Chinese experts and selling them through supermarkets, Facebook and social media.
The profit of growing mushroom are 20-30 times higher than her original cabbage cultivation, and the expansion of her earnings has allowed her to independently set up a tube production workshop, and her Juncao mushroom business is booming.
Farmers have planted more than 130 hectares of Juncao grass, and 1798 households have raised chickens, pigs, sheep, cows and other livestock using Juncao grass, significantly reducing their costs. 
In 7 districts including Goroka, Lufa, Hengenofi, Unggai Bena, Daulo and Kainantu, the project has promoted upland rice cultivation over 1215 hectares, and has supported more than 20 large upland rice producers and cooperatives, and promoted 7604 growers, which has brought great economic benefits to the local community.
The implementation of the project has promoted the development of Juncao, livestock and upland rice industries in PNG through technical training and demonstration, and opened up a new way for increasing employment and farmers’ income, as well as environmental protection, coping with climate change and sustainable development in PNG.

The K117 million four-lane road from 9 Mile to Pacific Adventist University was finally launched yesterday and will open doors for economic growth and connectivity between the people of Central province to the National Capital District.
Prime Minister James Marape and NCD Governor Powes Parkop, along with other members of parliament officially cut the ribbon yesterday afternoon after three years of construction declaring the road open.
Mr Marape said roads in the nation’s capital and all across the country allow for the growth of economy especially for small subsistence farmers who depend on proper road access to take their produce to markets. He urged locals and residents to fully utilise the full potential of this road.
“Roads carries the economy and not the other way around. Road and enabling infrastructures carries the economy and today under the flagship program of the Connect PNG program we are punching roads to places that have never seen roads before and not just the nation’s capital,” stated Mr Marape.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop also highlighted that the road offers an economic corridor for the people of Central province into the city thus connecting the farmers to the market and the city to the educational hub that lies within the 9 mile to 14 mile area.
“This road holds great significance for our city and for our country. It serves a vital artery connecting the commercial part of our city to what I say the educational hub of our city.
“As we witness the completion of this infrastructure project we affirm our commitment to the transformation of Port Moresby to a truly national capital,” he stated.
The four lane road was constructed by a local construction company Mobile Works. The ground breaking ceremony was held in 2020 and it was funded by the BSP Financial Group Limited at the guarantee of the national government.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Marape urged locals along the road to use the road for their economic benefit as well as to take proper care of the road.
“This road must return its investment to the country. I want to ask all our citizens to take ownership of this road. Don’t spit and litter on this road.
“Your government will work to give fines and penalties. It must start in the nation’s capital, live life, drive must be fitting of a modern infrastructure. No time for recklessness,” he warned.

Chinese company express gratitude to PNG government - Post Courier

The chairman of the Metallurgical Corporation of China (MCC), Chen Jianguang, has expressed his gratitude for the warm invitation and the continued support from the government of PNG towards the Metallurgical Corporation of China (MCC) after a one-on-one meeting with Prime Minister James Marape in Hong Kong recently.
Chairman Jianguang said: “I am deeply encouraged by the Prime Minister’s confidence in our operations and our potential contribution to the economic growth of Papua New Guinea.
“I recognise the importance of the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt project in Madang Province, not just for MCC, but also for the people and economy of Papua New Guinea. 
Therefore, I take the suggestion of partnering with the National Government and its efforts very seriously. 
As MCC plans its expansion in PNG, we will consider this partnership a strategic move that aligns with our mutual interests.
“The invitation for MCC to diversify into other resource sectors, including clean energy, is an exciting prospect. 
I agree that this could open up new avenues for development and enhance our contribution to Papua New Guinea’s sustainable growth.
“The existing government-to-government and people-to-people relationships between China and Papua New Guinea have fostered a conducive environment for our operations. 
I believe further investment in Papua New Guinea will only strengthen these relationships, and I am confident that the PNG government will support it.
“I want to reiterate the MCC’s commitment to contribute to the development of Papua New Guinea. 
MCC aims to create more jobs for Papua New Guineans, expand current investment and explore other investment sectors. 
MCC believes its success is intertwined with the prosperity of Papua New Guinea and its people,” he said.
MCC is a global company, and the Ramu Nickel and Cobalt mine project in PNG is a small part of the business portfolio. 
MCC was invited under a government bilateral agreement between PNG and the People’s Republic of China at the invitation of the PNG Government to develop the mine after all other companies did not want to acquire the mine because it was not feasible and not profitable.
He said the initial years of construction were very challenging, and the first eight years of operation were unprofitable and not feasible. MCC, however, continued to persevere under weak economic and market conditions because it was a commitment from the government of China and the people of China to the government of PNG and the people of PNG and stood as a representation of friendship between the two nations.
The chairman said the longstanding political and economic relationship between Asia and Papua New Guinea is set to deepen following the Papua New Guinea – Asia Investment Conference aimed at enhancing investment and trade ties.
He said China, the second-largest economy globally and the largest in Asia, has always valued its investment and co-operation within Papua New Guinea, contributing significantly to its economic and social development.
In the face of increasing global economic pressures and uncertainties, the trend for countries to deepen co-operation across various fields is more crucial than ever. 
This year marks the 5th anniversary of Papua New Guinea’s involvement in “The Belt and Road Initiative”, signalling a significant milestone in our partnership.

CHINA’s president Xi Jinping has vowed to safeguard PNG’s sovereignty and security amidst ongoing geopolitical tussles in the region after China cemented its relations with eight new agreements and a 100 million RMB grant from the Belt and Road Initiative to PNG.
Xi committed China’s support when he met with Prime Minister James Marape in Beijing last Tuesday following Marape’s successful bilateral meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang.
In a statement later, Xi said China will safeguard PNG’s national sovereignty, security and development interests in accordance with development path suited to PNG’s national conditions.
“China supports Papua New Guinea in playing a bigger role in international and regional affairs, and stands ready to strengthen communication and coordination with PNG on major international and regional issues to safeguard the common interests of developing countries,” said Xi. 
He said China will also provide Chinese state enterprises to partner and develop downstream processing facilities for fisheries, forestry, and coffee, under the Belt and Road Initiative amongst the eight agreements that were signed last Monday.
Mr Marape in turn re-affirmed PNG’s One-China policy and commitment to the Belt and Road Initiative.
“The main focus of my discussions with President Xi was securing a shared future through increased trade and investment through people to people and business to business relations,” Marape said and highlighted PNG’s vast land area and its potential to export food and clean geothermal energy to China.
He was the only Pacific Island leader invited to Beijing to attend the third Belt and Road Forum. He also engaged in several high level bilateral meetings.

Koura Way had to be cut through new terrain joining the Port Moresby backwater suburb of June Valley and Hanuabada, and also opening up the area for development.
The project, costing the NCDC K80 million, adds to the fast-developing road network for the Nation’s Capital.
However, that has done little to ease the traffic congestion between 7.30am and 8.30am every morning from Monday to Friday.
It was opened in September 2018 by then Works Minister Michael Nali.
Minister Nali at the time said: “The city is moving in the right direction, you have the opening of this K80 million road project, you know the Government has given up to K2 billion to National Capital District Commission for all these roads, stadiums, all hospitals, and the flyover.
“When we built the Poreporena Freeway, critics said it was a waste of money, yet they drive on the freeway,” he said.
Koura Way itself is 4.5km with the bypass to Poreporena Freeway opening at two locations behind the police headquarters and near the Weigh Inn motel.
However, as seen in the pictures taken by Post-Courier, over time the road heading into the Ranuguri tunnel has eroded and a near sinkhole opened up before it was closed, however the road kept dropping.
According to information received the road will be closed for the next few weeks.

A famous track used by the colonial administrators to travel between Koroba and Lake Kopiago in the Hela Province has been rehabilitated, thanks to the local MP Mr William Bando who spent no time to open up that missing link.
The Koroba-Kopiago district development authority, under the leadership of their local MP Mr William Bando, wasted no time to construct the Teria-Yagabi to Kakoma road, a colonial track that was used as a short cut to travel between Koroba and Kopaigo.
The Teria-Yaguabi to Kakoma road is among 8 other rundown roads that are undergoing major rehabilitation and maintenance, a major development initiative undertaken by the local MP within the first one year in office. 
Since being elected into office, Mr Bando prioritised law and order and road network in his district. 
He said opening up road accessibility and opening up missing links and rundown road network in the province can change mindsets and the perception of people and there he wasted no time to rehabilitate all the major road network in the district that have been neglected by past leaderships.
According to the locals, the Teria-Yaguabi –Kakoma road project took just less than 4 months and covered almost 7 kilometres, and it is about to reach the main Highlands Highway which will be connecting the frontiers of Tumbutu valley in the North of Koroba to Kopiago Basin excessing 32 council wards of more than 50, 000 population which used to be known as ‘back-page’ due to lack of services delivery.
“Opening up missing link road and rehabilitation of the old colonial roads that have deteriorated overtime is indeed a welcome initiative of the MP.
“We appreciate the MPs tireless construction team on the ground for the tremendous work done in a speedy limit, providing some of the best road construction we have never seen before. 
We also acknowledge the Mr Bando for his leadership, irrespective of the political difference, he is equally distributing services to everyone and that is the kind of leadership we want to see, a matured, smart and innovative leadership,” a local said on the Koroba-Kopaigo social media forum.

THE new Mount Bosavi road in the Nipa-Kutubu district of the Southern Highlands Province is pushing further into the thick jungles towards the mighty Tagali River.
Last week, the contractor and locals organised a small feast, a traditional practice to allow nature to release the land and the environment that has never being disturbed by humans, and to allow machines to cut through the forest.
If such special traditional offerings are not done then it is anticipated that they would encounter problems and bad luck in their efforts to build a road. 
After the feast, killing pigs and sprinkling pig’s blood, the machines are now cutting into the virgin forest toward the Tagali River.
The road, when completed, will serve more than 20,000 people locked away in that part of the country, located between Kutubu, Komo in Hela, Gulf and Middle Fly district in Western Province.
The Bosavi area is one of the world heritage sites, home to some of the unique plants and animals.
People from the area usually walk for more than four days through thick jungles to arrive at Waro in the Lower Foi of Lake Kutubu or fly by MAF to Mt Hagen.
Nipa-Kutubu MP Dr Billy Joseph made an initial funding of K5 million of the Nipa-Kutubu District Development Authority funds to buy bulldozers, excavators, trucks to start the process by cutting through thick virgin forest.
The 48-kilometre road, is part of the Government’s Connect PNG program but the most difficult part of the road is building an 800-metre at one of the narrow part over the Tagali River.

Obura-Wonenara MP John Boito has fulfilled his commitment to have an excavator to start working from the back of the district towards the front.He said he had made this commitment onboard a helicopter on his campaign run to Andakombi in Marawaka in the 2022 National General Elections with ward member Michael Kudea, who requested for an excavator, if he is elected. “I told him over Vailala mountain that today you sit with me in this helicopter, but if I win tomorrow, you will get an excavator,” Mr Boito said.“I could not forget this commitment because we made it in the air, not on the ground.”The excavator and a dump truck were driven to the Asakumdi community in ward eight of the Kome local level government area in Mynyamya district, Morobe Province, where road works will begin from towards Matawaka to wherever it meets with two more excavators working from Aiyura going backwards.Mr Boito said he would work with his colleague Solen Moifa to have this part of the country connected and continue to Sindeni to link up with the Trans-Highway to Gulf and Central Province now under construction.He also made it clear to the people that the Eastern Highlands provincial government, under the chairmanship of Simon Sia, is helping him to move the changes taking place in the district.Moks Takaje, on behalf of the Asakumdi community, reflected on the launching of the Obura-Wonenara district five-year development plan at the Aiyura Valley near Kainantu a month ago, which focuses on road infrastructure, including sending an excavator to the back of Marawaka to start work from there.“This has now been fulfilled and we now commit ourselves to work together,” Mr Takaje said.Robert Rodney, on behalf of the Marawaka community, said most of the people in this part of the country have no idea of what an excavator is.“We just celebrated our 48th independence anniversary last weekend and all those years, we have not had an excavator coming this way, even a dump truck for that matter,” Mr Rodney said.Mr Boito honoured this commitment one year and a month after the declaration of his election as the MP for Obura-Wonenara in the 2022 National General Elections and three days after the Papua New Guinea’s 48th independence celebrations nationwide on September 16, 2023. The people from the rolling mountains gathered at Asakumdi to welcome Mynyamya MP Solen Moifa and Eastern Highlands Governor Simon Sia who joined Mr Boito for the presentation of the excavator.Mr Sia assured them that more machines will be coming to speed up the work in connecting these isolated communities tucked away behind the rolling mountains and encouraged the young people to take their education seriously, adding that the government is committed to supporting human resource development program.Mr Moifa stressed the importance of road access to allow services into their areas, and appealed to his people to take ownership of the heavy equipment machines. including the ones working on the Mynyamya district road.He stressed on their cooperation in terms of letting their land for the development to take place and looking after the machineries and the workers.Mr Boito also stressed on the local cooperation as well.“We will celebrate when we launch the opening of the road,” Mr Boito said.“Now is not the time.”

Today, the Hon. Powes Parkop, NCD Governor, inaugurated the walkway and water supply rehabilitation projects at Gabi village in the National Capital District.
The projects, which were initiated by the Gulf Provincial Government (GPG) for its people living in NCD, were funded by 3 percent of the GST revenue sharing arrangement NCDC has with the GPG under the recent amendment to the NCDC Act.
Also in attendance were Gulf Governor, Sir Chris Haiveta and his PEC members, Moresby North-West MP, Hon. Lohia Boe Samuel and Motu Koitabu leaders.
This launch marks the beginning of a new era, rewriting future narratives based on mutual friendship, understanding, unity, and partnership among Gulf, NCD, and Motu Koita leadership.
Recent amendments to the NCDC Act, tabled by Governor Parkop and passed by Parliament, enabled this small but significant moment.
Governor Parkop expressed his satisfaction and commitment to this new chapter being forged, along with the continued cooperation and alignment between Gulf, Central, MKA, and NCDC.
Clarifying demarcation of mandated roles and duties, Governor Parkop said NCDC and his office are responsible for major infrastructure developments in the city whilst the open MPs and the indigenous government are focussed on basic services like walk-ways, water supply and SME empowerment etc…
He highlighted such projects delivered at Motu Koita villages include Voe Vagi road re-sealing and streetlights, rehabilitation of education infrastructure, rehabilitation of Baruni and Tatana roads to name the three.
He urged residents to embrace a peaceful and friendly indigenous lifestyle and culture while refraining from causing problems in the city.
Gulf Governor Haiveta announced that his PEC has resolved to allocate one percent of the three-percent GST component they receive from NCDC to the people of the Gulf living in NCD through community project initiatives.
Governor Haiveta supported Governor Parkop’s call, emphasizing that provincial ethnic groups should leave their problems behind when migrating to the city. He stressed that the city should become a centre for mutual understanding and friendship and a melting pot for people with cultural diversity living together in unity.
Sir Chris said as part of this collaboration, he has invited fellow Governor Parkop and other NCD leaders to participate in the propsed Papua LNG’s Development Forum which will be held later.
Today’s occasion marks the beginning of collaboration and cooperation based on mutual trust, respect, and understanding among provinces and their people. 
The time for arguments and conflicts is over. Now, hand in hand, we journey to shape a better future for our people.
