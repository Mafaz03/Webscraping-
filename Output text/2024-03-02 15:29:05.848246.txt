The government’s Connect PNG program has hit a huge pothole.Former prime minister Peter O’Neill has likened Connect PNG to a scam, which has sparked a public debate with Prime Minister James Marape, with his Works and Implementation Minister Solan Mirisim weighing in to support Mr Marape.Messrs O’Neill and Marape have traded barbs on the CPNG project, a K20 billion project to be funded over the next 20 years to essentially link up all the major centres in Papua New Guinea.Mr Marape has been particularly rattled by assertions by Mr O’Neill that a certain contractor allegedly allied to the Prime Minister has been showered with contracts amounting to K3.5 billion.
Mr Marape hit back straight away yesterday, attacking Mr O’Neill’s “shady” reputation when he was prime minister.Prime Minister Marape denied having shareholding as claimed by O’Neill.Instead he said: “Peter O’Neill was known for giving contracts to his own companies, and foreign companies, unlike now where we have over 300 local companies operating in all corners of our country.”While the two were at it, East Sepik Governor Allan Bird, a government backbencher, questioned the processes and procedures for the application of the project.He said the project seems to have breached the Constitution and that funding planned for one year appears to overlap into the following year’s budget.Mr Bird questioned the validity of the program in a long post on his social media account (see separate story).Yesterday, Mr O’Neill released a statement alleging the Connect PNG program as a scam and documents given to him by concerned public servants, revealed a staggering amount of money being paid allegedly to close associates of Mr Marape.He singled out an alleged K3.5 billion contract awarded to Ipwenz Construction, including other contracts to Amaku and Sons Construction Ltd; Construct Oceanic Ltd; CivPac and Albe Ltd.“Only a proper, independent audit will establish all the facts of what has gone on and continues to go on with the Connect PNG program.”Mr Marape hit back straight away, saying Mr O’Neill had “a far shadier and dishonest reputation” of awarding contracts to his own companies during his time as prime minister.He said Mr O’Neill should take a good look at himself before tainting the reputations of Papua New Guinea contractors.“When Peter O’Neill points a finger at PNG contractors, there are four more pointing back at him,” Prime Minister Marape said when rebutting accusations by Mr O’Neill.Ipwenz Construction owner Moses Palipe denied his company has seen any of the amounts suggested by Mr O’Neill.He said that the former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia has stooped too low to raise serious allegation against Ipwenz Construction Limited.Yesterday, at a press conference with Sinasina Yongomugl MP Kerenga Kua and other Opposition MPs, O’Neill continued his attack on Connect PNG.“Our nation’s financial stability is at stake right under the noses of the International Monetary Fund and other donors such as China and Australia. There is no way that anybody knows about what is going on,” O’Neill said.“I understand there is a lack of confidence that the Commissioner of Police or the Ombudsman Commission are free to do their work and public servants feel they have nowhere else to turn to bring light to these allegations of serious misappropriation.”Works Minister Solan Mirisim defended the program supporting Prime Minister Marape that “The recent media statement by former Prime Minister and Member for Ialibu-Pangia that a single national contractor has been awarded a K3.5 billion worth contract was ridiculous, misleading and very cunning and deceptive allegation raised at this juncture of VONC.”He said: “Papua New Guineans must not forget that Peter O’Neill is known for inflated contracts creating huge debt traps that our government is currently clearing. He must be ashamed of records of uncontrolled spending on creating highways to nowhere and forgetting the rural road access serving 85% of the rural population. To come and point fingers at the Marape Government for building local contractors is very hypocritical and deceptive.”

Land and maritime project enhances climate Resilience of road network and wharves in Solomon Islands - Post Courier

The Land and Maritime Connectivity Project that is supported by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is delivering results and is already boosting land and maritime connectivity and strengthening the transport network in Solomon Islands.
In keeping with ADB’s role as Asia and the Pacific’s climate bank, Solomon Islands’ vulnerability to floods and cyclones has been considered in designing the roads and wharves to be developed by the project, contributing to the enhancement of the disaster resilience of the country’s transport network. 
The project will improve the east–west corridor of Guadalcanal, which passes through central Honiara. This stretch of road is a lifeline for local people and allows them to access essential services and pursue socioeconomic activities. 
Given the importance of maritime transport for the country’s economy, the project will also better the Honiara International Port and develop wharves in the provinces of Makira-Ulawa and Rennell and Bellona.
The rehabilitation works on the 5-kilometer section from Henderson Airport along the Mberande road were completed in 2023, and the ones on the Tandai Highway are expected to be completed within 2024. 
Work underway in Honiara, Guadalcanal and shows the installation of underground stormwater drainage pipes.Mberande Road, Honiara, preparatory work before asphalt surfacing.
Preparatory work is underway for the rehabilitation of Honiara’s International Port and the construction of wharves at Ahanga and Kira Kira.
“The Land and Maritime Connectivity Project will be transformational for the population in Solomon Islands, particularly those who live in rural areas and need regular access to economic opportunities and basic services for stable livelihoods,” said ADB Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office Regional Director Shane Rosenthal. 
“The project will help provide all-year access to such opportunities and services, as climate-resilient features that have been integrated into the design of the project roads and wharves.” 
“This project will reshape land and maritime infrastructure in Solomon Islands,” said Acting Permanent Secretary for Infrastructure Development Allan Lilia. “It is already delivering results, carrying out rehabilitation work along the Mberande Road and toward Tandai Highway, which composes the critical road link on the Guadalcanal Island.”
The capacity of the Ministry of Infrastructure Development will be strengthened by the project, through support in planning, project preparation, procurement, and other transport sector institutional reform. 
As part of the institutional strengthening, the project will help the Ministry of Infrastructure Development develop a gender strategy and provide capacity development training programs to female staff.
The project is funded by a concessional loan of $74.4 million and a grant of $74.5 million from the Asian Development Fund, which provides grants to ADB’s poorest and most vulnerable developing member countries. 
The Government of the Solomon Islands is contributing the remaining $21.8 million of the project’s overall cost of almost $171 million.
ADB is committed to achieving a prosperous, inclusive, resilient, and sustainable Asia and the Pacific, while sustaining its efforts to eradicate extreme poverty. Established in 1966, it is owned by 68 members—49 from the region.

Remington Group CEO, Peter Goodwin has called out that there is a more-than-urgent need for PNG Power to address the underlying issues causing persistent blackouts.
Mr Goodwin said operating under these terrible conditions is incredibly challenging for any business.
He said the frequent blackouts have not only damaged their equipment but have also impeded our ability to serve our clients efficiently.
“We are deeply concerned about the long-term impact that a failing PNG Power has on not only our own businesses, but those of the wider business community and the PNG economy, which is already in a state of flux,” said Goodwin.
He said the reliable and consistent electricity supply is essential for us to sustain our businesses, to facilitate economic growth, and keep our people employed.
“I know that we are not the only businesses struggling to keep their generators fully functional, despite proper ongoing maintenance programs. The constant off, on, off, on, off… is straining even the best systems,” said Goodwin.
“We urge PNG Power to take responsibility for these disruptions and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.
“The country has already faced huge disruptions to businesses since the start of the year,” added Goodwin.
BizPrint and Scan, a business unit under the Remington Group of Companies based at Konedobu, Port Moresby has struggled to service its customers due to continuous power disruptions.
The Power outages have impacted the company’s ability to function at full capacity, resulting in tangible damage to its generator and thus severely hindering productivity.
BizPrint and Scan generator is unserviceable and waiting on parts from abroad, the continuous blackouts, also being suffered by other business houses and clubs at Konedobu and surrounding suburbs, have resulted in the BizPrint and Scan limiting their operations.

Mando Andawayufa Community in Lower Asaro LLG in Daulo District in the Eastern Highlands built a road with spades to give vehicle access to the new high school.
Community leader Jackie Girupe said Mando Lutheran High School was on the same school grounds as the Primary School for over four years.
“Students are using the same facilities and due to space limitations, the landowners have given land to the church to erect a new high school.
Mr Girupe said the relocation of the high school needs road access to transport building supplies to the school.
He added several requests from the local community to the district MPs had not been successful, however, the community had taken action to construct the road themselves with spades, knives, and digging sticks.
Mr Girupe said the community led the initiative in 2020 using their bare hands to build the road to give vehicle access.
“Community had taken responsibility to make contributions in their own will to assist the construction of the road in the last few years.
The appeal for road access was finally heard by the provincial government under the leadership of Transport, Civil Works Division (TCWD) Director, Melki Zedeck Ohaeo who assisted with machines to fast-track the construction.
The machine’s valued assistance gave relief for the Mando-Andawayufa clan from their tiring digging and construction with their bare hands.
Mr Girupe said the road was completed recently with the help of TCWD.
He said the road will benefit over 200 students from the high school and teachers plus other staff commuting to school.
Mr Girupe said the road was a gift for the local community and district and especially the school with its students.
The community had named the newly established road after TCWD, Director “Melki Ohae”Mr Girupe said the Daulo District Development Authority and Eastern Highlands Provincial Administration and government will be assisting this year in the school’s relocation project.

The Government has spent over K400 million on the construction and expansion of Missing Link Roads throughout PNG over the last four years says Minister for Works and Highways, Solan Mirisim today in the Parliament.
Minister Mirisim said the returns on this will have a generational effect in the future.
He said the provincial and district roads makes up 21, 000 Km of the 30Km of PNG’s Road Network, serving 85 percent of the rural road network.
Mr Mirisim added that the record shows that his department and the Dept of National Planning and Monitoring have been continuously funding road projects worth more than K2 billion since 2019 supplementary Budget.
“This translates to an enormous 60 percent of the total connect PNG Capital Expenditure going to rural roads,” said Minister
He said Districts like Sinasina Yongomugl in Chimbu and Pangia Iyalibu in Southern Highlands on the opposition side are benefitting from this funding given directly from the national Planning department.
“More of the funding is going to the rural roads and under mutual obligations as compared to Past years.
“I asked all of us to make us of the funds to improve critical road infrastructure to improve and increase road connectivity and accessibility for our people to access services and markets to improve livelihoods,” Minister added.
He said that there are many road projects are financed directly at the provincial and district levels, making it challenging to provide a comprehensive and reliable assessment of achievements to date due to Data and information limitations.
Mr Mirisim said based on reports from the provinces, there are more than 40 percent (Approx. 1, 200 Km) of the phase 1 target of 3,000Km has been upgraded to a good condition.

A new government will get to the bottom of the illegal payments to jailed lawyer Paul Paraka and the management of the controversial Connect PNG Program.This is the word from National Party leader and former senior government minister, Kerenga Kua.“Yes, definitely. The new government will investigate into these very serious matters.“We are talking about a lot of money…in the case of the Connect PNG Program, its about K50 billion,” said Mr Kua.Mr Kua said the National Court has established that the K162 million payment to Paraka was illegal and the receiver is serving time in jail for the crime.“How about the facilitators and beneficiaries. One of the facilitators has been arrested and charged. What about the political facilitator? What about the minister involved? What about the current Prime minister, who wrote that letter, directing the payment it all started from there?“Why is he not arrested?” said Kua, who recently resigned as the Petroleum and Energy minister from the Marape Government.Kua is critical over the handling of the Paraka matter by the PNG police.He said police commissioner, David Manning had five years to investigate the whole matter and arrest everyone who were involved but he suppressed it.“The police commissioner was appointed in 2019. He had five years to get this thing moving. Why has he suppressed it for five years and counting? He has a lot to answer to the people of Papua New Guinea,” he pointed out.Mr Kua said the police must uncover everything and arrest everyone who facilitated the payment and who benefited from the money. “Paul Paraka has no investments here in his name that we know. He is in jail and the police need to visit him and talk to him. K162 million is a lot of money to disappear like that,” he said.On the controversial Connect PNG Program, the National Party leader said the Connect PNG Road Funding Act 2022 was breached.Mr Kua said among the many things covered under that Act, the funding level under the life of the program is set.“The Act does not give a specific time frame but the funding level is K20 billion for the life of the program. The government has already spent K50 billion on this program, that is well over the limit set by the Act. “Then we have other issues like who gets the contracts and who gets the projects.“K50 billion is a lot of money. If it was shared equally, every province would get about K2 billion and that is a lot of money. All transport infrastructure in every province will be fixed,” Mr Kua said.National Party MP, David Arore, said members of Parliament were in the dark over how the funds were distributed and roads projects were selected under the program.“The program is basically like an ATM machine for a few people to use to draw down money for projects to certain MPs.
