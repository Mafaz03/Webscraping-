PNG women’s soccer strike weapons not named in national team - Post Courier

The skipper-coach combination for the PNG women’s football team, Ramona Padio and Frederica Sakette, are the notable omission from the Olympic qualifier squad.
Padio and Sakette who were part of the 6th-time Pacific Games gold medal winning team last year in Honiara, were not named in the PNG women’s football team who will depart to Samoa tomorrow. 
In announcing the squad yesterday, PNGFA specified that Marie Kaipu will captain the team. 
Sakette’s successor is Hekari United FC women’s coach, Erickson Komeng.
Padio who played an important role in bringing home the sixth gold medal for the women’s national team at the Pacific Games last year, has been absent since the team resumed training three weeks ago in preparation for the Qualifiers.
PNGFA General Secretary Gordon Manub said Padio is in top shape to compete but, “the reason is that she wants her partner to travel along with her here, but that is something that we can’t cater for.”
Manub said he understands the support that the partner has provided for Padio’s career over the years, but at this stage they needed to get the team together and with Padio as the current captain of the women’s national team, following her appointment prior to the Pacific Games.
“We had to make adjustments and only had to change that yesterday (Wednesday), because we now are not sure if she will be coming, we paid for her tickets and want her to be part of the team.”
Manub said Padio has missed out on the training sessions, and if they want her here then she has to be here today as the team leaves tomorrow in preparation for the tournament.
“Oceania Football Confederation has a deadline for certain things and that includes the team list being entered system on time and flights booked three days prior to the tournament.”
He said if they don’t meet the deadlines then PNGFA gets penalised, but they have sorted out everything in their earliest conveniences.
“We are trying to improve and make sure that we do our work properly so that the players get the full benefit of our support and OFC has been behind us with our executive committee.”
With Padio’s absence from the squad and the field, it will leave a big gap in the mid-field.
Head Coach Erickson Komeng said with Padio not being part of the team as a mid-fielder it is similar to the Pacific Games when they didn’t travel with Yvonne Gabong, Lucy Maino who were seniors on the team.
