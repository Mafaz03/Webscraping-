The Kokopo Central Business District’s Williams Road is gradually becoming more and more dotted with potholes.
On a busy day, the traffic stalls. Vehicles that attempt to avoid these potholes pose risks to pedestrians as they cross the main road to shops or the main market.
The main crossing from the Kokopo market to K Central supermarket is always busy and potholes have also riddled this main crossing.

Up until today, the idea has remained a dream that has yet to be realised.
Motorists, mainly those on route 8B PMV buses, are pleading with authorities to patch the potholes, as an accident along this route is deemed unavoidable.

UPNG journalism studentThousands of people living in the Gerehu suburb in Port Moresby will for the next 12 months experience difficulties in commuting following the start of a year long road construction.After the completion of the first construction of the main area road from Gerehu stage one to stage six, another year construction work is underway in the corridors of Gerehu, along the bus stop next to the Bismillah shops.
According to Phoenix Construction who has undertaken the project, the half a mile road structure starting from the Gerehu main bus stop roundabout to the Kasia Cycle roundabout is anticipated to cause traffic congestion that will definitely impact daily commuters.Phoenix site engineer, Philimon Mondolame said the new road construction progress will depend on the funding from the National Capital District Commission.“The reason for working at one section of the road at a time is because the funding is not paid in full but in installments so the funds are released when a block of the road is completed,” he said.
Another factor that significantly affect construction is weather as periods of heavy rain hinder any progress.Mr Mondale noted that traffic is currently being controlled by blocking the road in front of Gerehu Mart in order to work on the left side of the bus stop.Once the bus stop is completed then the blockade will be shifted and normalcy should return.

Construction will soon begin on the Indagen-Lae Road project in Kabwum, Morobe Province.
Morobe Governor Luther Wenge did the ground-breaking ceremony in Indagen village last Friday witnessed by people from the Komba, Selepet and Deyamos local level governments.
Governor Wenge said the people of Kabwum really need a road link to Lae and this road will be a priority.
He said funding of K2 million from Morobe provincial services improvement program has been allocated to upgrade the road from Tipsit to Indagen.
“Once this is done, I will allocate another K10 million for road construction to begin from Indagen in Kabwum to Burum-Kuat in Finschhafen and finally into Samanzing in Nawaeb to Lae,” he said.
“Work on this road should start in the next three weeks once machineries are shipped to Wasu from Lae.
“It will start here in Indagen and then going towards Lae and not from Lae to Indagen.”
Governor Wenge said Finschhafen MP Rainbo Paita and Prime Minister James Marape have pledged commitments to support the road project.
However, he did not reveal the commitments pledge but stated that he will closely follow-up with them on this funding commitments to deliver this economic road for the people of Kabwum.

A THIRTY-six kilometre Ring Road Project in the Rigo North LLG of Rigo District in Central Province has been completed by Koia Investment Company Limited.
The Ring Road will now serve 20 council wards of North Rigo LLG who have been suffering from lack of better road access for the last 27 years. The Ring Road project was funded by the Central Provincial Government under the works program.
Present during the completion of the road last Sunday (27th August) were ), respective community leaders of Rigo North owner of the construction company Biari Ubuna, Acting Police Station Commander of Kwikila police station, Sergeant Bobby Ogara and a representative from the Rigo district development authority.
A community Leader Murray Gini thanked the constructor and the Central provincial government for providing the needed service to the 17, 000 plus population of Rigo North.
“The 20 council wards in the hinterland of Rigo District gratefully accolade praise to the management of KICL for the construction of Sivitatana – Wiga road connection,” Gini said.
“The road has been cut off for public use for about 27 years ago, which in other words can be put as political negligence for the last 5 terms by the previous governments.
“The Prime Minister James Marape declared the Rigo Inland Ring Road as Yagabo Highway when he was invited at Boregaina Village in late 2020 and he had announced K27 million for the road project.
In proceed to that announcement, this portion of the road was not accounted for and this has led our people to uncertainty of the effectiveness of government commitments.
“The people of Rigo North wish to give special thanks and accord to KICL, our sincere appreciation for the great achievement in bringing the road home to us.”
Biari thanked the leaders and people of Rigo North for working together with the constructor and successfully completed the project.
“The constructor is not here to make money but to deliver the needed service to the people of Rigo North.
Even though the scope of the road project ends at Dilikomana village, yet we have continued further for about 8 kilometres to Matanatou Sub Health Centre to fully connect the Ring Road. 
Biari further acknowledged and thanked the Central provincial government for making the funding available to complete the Ring Road project.

SinAsinA-Yongomugl District Development Authority in Chimbu Province has overcome all odds penetrating through rugged terrains of the district to finally seal the Kamtai to Muaina road in the Suai Local Level Government area.SSYDDA chief executive officer Obert Waure said yesterday that the road project started during the last term of Parliament and had continued into this term.He said local contractor Kaiaworks Civil Engineering Contractors had been carrying out works and the sealing will continue from Kamtai to Muaina and reach Koge.
“From Koge, the road will go further up to Dom in Yobamorua and to Gunangi in Suai LLG. This will pave way for basic government services to reach the outlying rural communities,” he said.Mr Waure said bad road network in rural districts such as SSY was an impediment to deliver basic services, including health, education and boosting the rural economy.He also called on the people living along the road to take ownership and volunteer to keep the road clean, plant flowers along the side of the road and always clear the vegetation along the road.

Contractors doing maintenance work on the Highlands Highway under the Asian Development Bank funded Sustainable Highlands Highway Investment Program have been commended on the progress of the project.Minister for Works and Highways Solan Mirisim praised the contractors for maintaining the phase of the project despite bad weather with other unprecedented holdups.Mr Mirisim was accompanied by Works secretary David Wereh with project engineers and Department of Works and Highways (DoWH) staff who did a site inspection from Nadzab turn off in Morobe province to Kagamuga turn off in Western Highlands province last week.
“Highlands Highway is the spine of PNG; it contributes more than 70 per cent of the national economy.“We want to see the highway done up to standard,” he said.“Sirnbu section is a very critical part of this highway and being physically here to see the work done so far I am very impressed.
“I can see that you have come up with solutions on how best the road can sustain the weather and land movement.“It is always a case in point that successive governments and the department continue to invest most of the funds in the maintenance and rehabilitation on this section,” he said.Mr Minisim said the national government negotiated a multi tranche Financing Facility with the Asia Development Bank and secure loan financing for the improvement of the current state of the Highlands Highway.
He said SHHIP program has been implemented under three separate tranches at the project ceiling of US$1.0 billion (K3.6 billion).He added that ADB has committed US$650 million, PNG government counter-funded US$200 million while co-financer (DFAT) contributed US$150 million.“The program has seen major repair of a total length of 430 kilometres. The project scope for Tranche 1 covers the executing agency.

Projects roll on as Belt and Road Initiative reaches milestone - Post Courier

China’s Belt and Road Initiative has gained momentum since its commencement 10 years ago in 2013.
Initially it had a regional focus but rapidly expanded beyond central Asia towards the Middle East, Africa, South America, Eastern Europe and the Indo Pacific regions, making it the biggest such program since the Marshall Plan after World War II.
Logically, there was a sharp increase in the number of projects, total investments committed and executed, and the number of countries joining as partners. 
The current number of countries and organizations stand at over 150.
China stressed that the BRI was a new model for partnership, trade and integration that was free from hegemonic pressures and conditions. Later the principles of multilateralism, environment and sustainability were embedded in the BRI.
The West, fearing China’s rapid influence through the BRI, came up with competing initiatives such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (G7), the Global Gateway (EU), the Quality Infrastructure Investment Program (Japan), and others, but their ability to rival the BRI in scale is yet to be established.
As PNG joined these 150 other countries and organizations in Beijing this month to review their involvements in the BRI, the Post-Courier takes a brief look at three projects that have been rolled out in PNG under the auspices of the BRI.
The PNG national power grid, which includes a 132kV transmission and substations for Mt Hagen, Mendi, Tari, represents the first collaborative energy infrastructure endeavor between PNG and China under the Belt and Road Initiative.
This project closely aligns with PNG’s national energy strategy, which aims to increase electricity accessibility from the current 15% to 70% by 2030 and ultimately transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050.
The project is funded by the China Exim Bank and executed by the contractor TBEA Co., Ltd.
The project owner is PNG Power, the project scope consists of the construction of four new 132kV substations (Mt. Hagen, Pauanda, Mendi, and Tari) and a 180-kilometer 132kV transmission line connecting these substations.
Upon completion, it significantly increased the power grid coverage, effectively alleviated energy shortages, and greatly improved grid stability and reliability in the Highlands region.
The project directly benefits residents of the three Highlands provinces (Western Highlands Province, Southern Highlands Province and Hela Province) and provides power to adjacent mining projects, including gold and copper mines.
Consequently, it will efficiently stimulate economic growth in those regions connected by the power grid. 
This initiative can also meet the electricity demands of millions of households and residents, thus improving the quality of life for local communities.
Before 2015, due to the complex geographical environment and insufficient transportation infrastructure, internet access remained relatively expensive in PNG, with only about 12 percent of PNG residents connected to the internet.
There was no backbone network in PNG. The backbone communication network between islands was mainly low-bandwidth and high-cost transmission network such as satellite and microwave. The bandwidth was limited.
New services such as high-speed mobile Internet could not be launched. 
With the development of the local economy, the existed bandwidth could not meet the market requirements.
The PNG National Submarine Cable Network Project (NSCNP) was implemented by PNG DataCo Ltd, a wholesale subsidiary of Kumul Telikom Holdings and a State-owned commercial entity.
This project was one of the high priority projects included in the Framework Agreement on Development Cooperation between China and PNG signed on July 8, 2016. 
The project was financed by EXIM Bank and was completed in June 2020.
This project was a 5457km submarine fiber cable network project connecting 14 major cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang and Lae. 
At the same time, 14 submarine cable landing sites were built in 14 cities in PNG, including Port Moresby, Madang, and Lae, to install submarine cable terminal equipment and network access equipment. 
Two data centers were also built in Port Moresby and Madang, used for supporting the operation of submarine cable services.
Firstly, the project has improved the bandwidth, reliability and stability of PNG’s domestic network.
It helped reduce the internet pricing by introducing competition mechanism;Secondly, the project connects PNG to China through Indonesia. 
The submarine cable has become an important international network channel for the South Pacific island countries;
Thirdly, the project drives the digital economy to help the country’s socio-economic progress and development.
Early in 2000, Fujian Province of China and Eastern Highlands Province of PNG signed a sister province agreement and listed Juncao and upland rice technology as the aiding technology to Eastern Highlands Province by Fujian Province. 
This project was carried out by the team of Prof. Lin Zhanxi from Fujian University of Agriculture and Forestry (FUAF). This project is now in its fourth phase.
In November 2018, during President Xi’s visit to PNG, leaders of the two countries witnessed the signing of the project, the first phase of which started in August 2019 and ended in August 2022. 
In February 2022, the two countries signed the second phase of the project, which will be implemented over a three-year period from September 2022 to August 2025.
The project has overcome the difficulties brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, and has overfulfilled the tasks of the project in the fields of training, demonstration, production and extension.
In total, 27 technical training courses have been held, and a total of 2,921 people have been trained; Juncao mushroom, Juncao animal husbandry, and upland rice planting have been promoted to 17 districts in nine provinces, with a total of more than 10,000 farmers and 40,000 people benefiting from the project; and set the world record for highest output of pennisetum giganteum (Juncao grass), which was 8.53 tons per hectare.
Eastern Highlands Province has listed the Juncao and upland rice industries as the second and third major agricultural industries to be developed after the coffee industry.
The project has benefited many farmers in PNG and improved the agricultural skills level of the farmers. 
It became a model of Belt and Road Initiative cooperation between China and PNG, and played a very important role in deepening the development cooperation between the two countries and the sister-province relationship between Fujian and Eastern Highlands provinces.
The project team has provided local farmers with 1,226,700 Juncao mushroom tubes, and more than 1,725 farmers have participated in the cultivating Juncao mushroom.
The farmers mainly produce oyster mushroom and sell the harvested fresh mushroom to supermarkets, local market and supermarkets in Port Moresby.
Zaka Abori, a woman mushroom farmer, started growing mushroom in February 2020 with the help of Chinese experts and selling them through supermarkets, Facebook and social media.
The profit of growing mushroom are 20-30 times higher than her original cabbage cultivation, and the expansion of her earnings has allowed her to independently set up a tube production workshop, and her Juncao mushroom business is booming.
Farmers have planted more than 130 hectares of Juncao grass, and 1798 households have raised chickens, pigs, sheep, cows and other livestock using Juncao grass, significantly reducing their costs. 
In 7 districts including Goroka, Lufa, Hengenofi, Unggai Bena, Daulo and Kainantu, the project has promoted upland rice cultivation over 1215 hectares, and has supported more than 20 large upland rice producers and cooperatives, and promoted 7604 growers, which has brought great economic benefits to the local community.
The implementation of the project has promoted the development of Juncao, livestock and upland rice industries in PNG through technical training and demonstration, and opened up a new way for increasing employment and farmers’ income, as well as environmental protection, coping with climate change and sustainable development in PNG.

The K117 million four-lane road from 9 Mile to Pacific Adventist University was finally launched yesterday and will open doors for economic growth and connectivity between the people of Central province to the National Capital District.
Prime Minister James Marape and NCD Governor Powes Parkop, along with other members of parliament officially cut the ribbon yesterday afternoon after three years of construction declaring the road open.
Mr Marape said roads in the nation’s capital and all across the country allow for the growth of economy especially for small subsistence farmers who depend on proper road access to take their produce to markets. He urged locals and residents to fully utilise the full potential of this road.
“Roads carries the economy and not the other way around. Road and enabling infrastructures carries the economy and today under the flagship program of the Connect PNG program we are punching roads to places that have never seen roads before and not just the nation’s capital,” stated Mr Marape.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop also highlighted that the road offers an economic corridor for the people of Central province into the city thus connecting the farmers to the market and the city to the educational hub that lies within the 9 mile to 14 mile area.
“This road holds great significance for our city and for our country. It serves a vital artery connecting the commercial part of our city to what I say the educational hub of our city.
“As we witness the completion of this infrastructure project we affirm our commitment to the transformation of Port Moresby to a truly national capital,” he stated.
The four lane road was constructed by a local construction company Mobile Works. The ground breaking ceremony was held in 2020 and it was funded by the BSP Financial Group Limited at the guarantee of the national government.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Marape urged locals along the road to use the road for their economic benefit as well as to take proper care of the road.
“This road must return its investment to the country. I want to ask all our citizens to take ownership of this road. Don’t spit and litter on this road.
“Your government will work to give fines and penalties. It must start in the nation’s capital, live life, drive must be fitting of a modern infrastructure. No time for recklessness,” he warned.

By MICHAEL KOMATHE responsibility is on the district development authorities to maintain roads in their respective districts.Chuave man Simon Gunua said this after seeing many potholes on the 13 kilometre Chuave-Movi road in the limestone-riddled district.
He said the road was sealed in 2007 by a road construction company with funding made available under the PIP “but successive DDAs and the Simbu Provincial Government had failed to maintain the stretch.He said the National Government has saved Chuave’s district service improvement program (DSIP) allocation by financing that particular road infrastructure project “so the DDA should patch the potholes and rehabilitate deteriorated
portions”.Gumine man Urmil Sine has echoed similar sentiments saying the Kundiawa-Gumine road also needs maintenance, and gave examples of deteriorating portions and potholes on the 43 kilometre stretch.
The road was sealed with funding allocated by the same source in 1998 when Aulkupa Patrick was the local MP.Mr Sine said: “Hardly any maintenance was carried out on the district’s major trunk road since bitumen was applied 22 years
ago.”Four men in Eastern Highlands remote Okapa and Lufa areas have also called on their DDAs to allocate funds for the Korefeigu-Lufa and the Korefeigu-Okapa station roads that serve an estimated 110,000 people.
Tribal and youth leaders in Gembogl, Kerowagi (Chimbu), Nondugl and Banz (Jiwaka), Mul-Baiyer and Tambul-Nebilyer (Western Highlands) and Porgera (Enga) have also expressed similar concerns.They called upon their respective DDAs to maintain sealed (trunk) roads in the districts to enable smooth flow of traffic from the rural areas to urban centres.

BY JOAN BAILEYA further K100 million has been committed by the Marape–Rosso Government to upgrade existing roads in Lae, the industrial capital of Morobe, in the coming years.Deputy Prime Minister and Lae MP John Rosso revealed this during the official launching of the Chinatown (Bumbu) Malahang road on Monday.

But I will try my best to maintain close consultation with Works and Highways Minister Solan Mirisim and secretary David Wereh, so hopefully we get some funding.“I am happy that our main road from Unitech to Tent City has been concreted followed by the Chinatown to Malahang Industrial Centre section of the Independence Drive,” he said.Mr Rosso said upgrading is now taking place on Mongola Street to a concreted high standard road.
He said plans are in place to secure funding for upgrading of Tent City to Busu Bridge and Second Seven dump to Bumayong roads to concrete roads in his second term in parliament.“Butibam to Kamkumung road will also be upgraded to concrete, while Kamkumung Bridge will be replaced with a new bridge to cater for four lanes.“Yalu Bridge has been contracted out already and work will begin soon to replace it with a new four lane bridge to complement the four lane Lae-Nadzab Highway.”Mr Rosso said in the last three years, the Pangu-led government has spent K3 billion on road constructions and they are committed to making roads accessible to the bulk of the population in the country.He also mentioned that the K400 million Yalu-Nadzab four-lane road project has been contracted out and work is progressing.
