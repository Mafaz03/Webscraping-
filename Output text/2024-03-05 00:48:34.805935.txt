The Kokopo Central Business District’s Williams Road is gradually becoming more and more dotted with potholes.
On a busy day, the traffic stalls. Vehicles that attempt to avoid these potholes pose risks to pedestrians as they cross the main road to shops or the main market.
The main crossing from the Kokopo market to K Central supermarket is always busy and potholes have also riddled this main crossing.

Up until today, the idea has remained a dream that has yet to be realised.
Motorists, mainly those on route 8B PMV buses, are pleading with authorities to patch the potholes, as an accident along this route is deemed unavoidable.

UPNG journalism studentThousands of people living in the Gerehu suburb in Port Moresby will for the next 12 months experience difficulties in commuting following the start of a year long road construction.After the completion of the first construction of the main area road from Gerehu stage one to stage six, another year construction work is underway in the corridors of Gerehu, along the bus stop next to the Bismillah shops.
According to Phoenix Construction who has undertaken the project, the half a mile road structure starting from the Gerehu main bus stop roundabout to the Kasia Cycle roundabout is anticipated to cause traffic congestion that will definitely impact daily commuters.Phoenix site engineer, Philimon Mondolame said the new road construction progress will depend on the funding from the National Capital District Commission.“The reason for working at one section of the road at a time is because the funding is not paid in full but in installments so the funds are released when a block of the road is completed,” he said.
Another factor that significantly affect construction is weather as periods of heavy rain hinder any progress.Mr Mondale noted that traffic is currently being controlled by blocking the road in front of Gerehu Mart in order to work on the left side of the bus stop.Once the bus stop is completed then the blockade will be shifted and normalcy should return.

On August 1, 2023, the Chief Ombudsman Richard Pagen contacted the City Manager Frank Ravu regarding concerns with the bypass road leading from the Konedobu Roundabout to the Koura Roundabout. 
This intervention was triggered by a recent natural disaster.
A statement from the OC states on July 7, 2023, a magnitude 5.5 earthquake struck the eastern part of Papua New Guinea.
The tremour caused structural damage to the road, primarily due to the inadequate compaction of its bottom layers, resulting in a noticeable depression on its surface.
This intervention by the OC was not in response to a specific complaint, but rather an own initiative to address an infrastructure issue in the city caused by the natural disaster.
Upon receiving the Chief’s communication, the City Manager promptly dispatched an engineering team to assess the situation and conduct a soil test to ensure the safety of commuters; gravel was laid as a temporary solution. 
While NCDC organised to engage a contractor for the complete repair of the road.
A road construction company was awarded the contract for 1 month to repair the road.
Within two weeks, they successfully completed one lane, and they are currently focused on completing the second lane.
The dimensions of the road repair cover a length of 60 metres, a width of 6 metres, and a depth of 3 metres, ensuring the restoration of a safe and strong roadway.
The Ombudsman Commission acknowledges and commends the City Manager Frank Ravu and his team for their swift response and proactive efforts in addressing this critical road infrastructure issue.
The timely intervention has ensured the safety and convenience of the commuters in the affected area.
The prompt response and successful road repair reflects the Ombudsman Commission’s commitment to public safety and efficient governance.

The poor state of the Bulolo Highway is a deterrent to the daily movement of company and public motor vehicles.Wau Waria MP Marsh Narewec who travelled to Wau described the state of road as one of the worst provincial roads in the Morobe Province.“I’m very disappointed with the contractor that was awarded the K110 million to carry out maintenance work on the Lae to Bulolo highway in 2021.“They haven’t done any major maintenance work on the highway.“Why is the contractor taking too long to mobilise equipment and move to set up its camp along the highway and start carrying out maintenance work on the road?” Mr Narewec asked.The state of the road from Postsie to Gawapu in Bulolo is a nightmare for motorists who use the road daily to conduct their businesses like highway trucks and the public transport system.The MP expressed his disappointment over the bad state of the road and said if the contractor fails to carry out the maintenance work on the highway, then the contract should be cancelled.“The contractor has held the companies, business houses and the general public to ransom with its don’t care attitude to carry out the maintenance work on the deteriorating highway,” Mr Narewec said.He said a PMV truck carrying passengers and coffee bags collided into an oncoming fuel tanker last week that claimed three lives.This could have been avoided, he added.He said the contractor should start working on the road now or it may seem that the funds allocated was used up already for a little bit of patching and sealing work from Markham Bridge to Potsie.Mr Narewec commended the NKW Road Construction team for doing good work by re-gravelling, patching and working on the drainage system from Timini bridge up to Gurakor village this month.“Failure to complete the maintenance work will result in bad precedence to the company’s reputation as a reputable road contractor who can be relied on to carry out professional work on any given road construction or maintenance work in the future,” he said.

Construction will soon begin on the Indagen-Lae Road project in Kabwum, Morobe Province.
Morobe Governor Luther Wenge did the ground-breaking ceremony in Indagen village last Friday witnessed by people from the Komba, Selepet and Deyamos local level governments.
Governor Wenge said the people of Kabwum really need a road link to Lae and this road will be a priority.
He said funding of K2 million from Morobe provincial services improvement program has been allocated to upgrade the road from Tipsit to Indagen.
“Once this is done, I will allocate another K10 million for road construction to begin from Indagen in Kabwum to Burum-Kuat in Finschhafen and finally into Samanzing in Nawaeb to Lae,” he said.
“Work on this road should start in the next three weeks once machineries are shipped to Wasu from Lae.
“It will start here in Indagen and then going towards Lae and not from Lae to Indagen.”
Governor Wenge said Finschhafen MP Rainbo Paita and Prime Minister James Marape have pledged commitments to support the road project.
However, he did not reveal the commitments pledge but stated that he will closely follow-up with them on this funding commitments to deliver this economic road for the people of Kabwum.

A THIRTY-six kilometre Ring Road Project in the Rigo North LLG of Rigo District in Central Province has been completed by Koia Investment Company Limited.
The Ring Road will now serve 20 council wards of North Rigo LLG who have been suffering from lack of better road access for the last 27 years. The Ring Road project was funded by the Central Provincial Government under the works program.
Present during the completion of the road last Sunday (27th August) were ), respective community leaders of Rigo North owner of the construction company Biari Ubuna, Acting Police Station Commander of Kwikila police station, Sergeant Bobby Ogara and a representative from the Rigo district development authority.
A community Leader Murray Gini thanked the constructor and the Central provincial government for providing the needed service to the 17, 000 plus population of Rigo North.
“The 20 council wards in the hinterland of Rigo District gratefully accolade praise to the management of KICL for the construction of Sivitatana – Wiga road connection,” Gini said.
“The road has been cut off for public use for about 27 years ago, which in other words can be put as political negligence for the last 5 terms by the previous governments.
“The Prime Minister James Marape declared the Rigo Inland Ring Road as Yagabo Highway when he was invited at Boregaina Village in late 2020 and he had announced K27 million for the road project.
In proceed to that announcement, this portion of the road was not accounted for and this has led our people to uncertainty of the effectiveness of government commitments.
“The people of Rigo North wish to give special thanks and accord to KICL, our sincere appreciation for the great achievement in bringing the road home to us.”
Biari thanked the leaders and people of Rigo North for working together with the constructor and successfully completed the project.
“The constructor is not here to make money but to deliver the needed service to the people of Rigo North.
Even though the scope of the road project ends at Dilikomana village, yet we have continued further for about 8 kilometres to Matanatou Sub Health Centre to fully connect the Ring Road. 
Biari further acknowledged and thanked the Central provincial government for making the funding available to complete the Ring Road project.

The noise of machines bulldozing and cutting into the thick virgin forest to build the first road into the landlocked and remote Bosavi local level government in the Nipa-Kutubu district is in indeed a 48th Independent Anniversary gift for these people in that part of the country.
Walking and hauling cargo on their backs like camels for days through thick forest and tough rugged terrains from Hidinia village in the Lower Foi in the Kutubu LLG to Mt Bosavi has been the normal practise for the people, when they did not have the money to pay for the expensive airfares from Mt Hagen.
The local MP Dr Billy Joseph has become the saviour of this forgotten people, when he and his district development authority decided to give these forgotten people an early 48 years Independence Anniversary gift.
Reality came to he fore when the first machine started working on the road to give access to the more than 20 000 people.
Thanks to Dr Joseph, the Bosavi road construction started on Monday this week when the first machine started to cut into the thick jungles to open up access.
More than 20 000 people live in this part of the area and despite being isolated, they made headlines recently on the kidnapping incidents.
Dr Joseph said the Nipa-Kutubu District Development Authority (NKDDA) with assitance from the Mt Bosavi LLG and the Kutubu LLG have injected the initial finding of K7million to start the construction of the road with no assistance from the Provincial and National Governments.
“Today is a historic and milestone occasion when the first machine started punching road into the landlocked communities.
“Our people live in poverty and have endured the hardships in life for almost 48 years since Independence with an absence of a road connectivity,” he said.

THE work on Bougainville’s next economical highway, the 33km Jaba-Paruparu road will now commence on its final 12 kilometres to reach Paruparu, a first in history.The K22 million road is being funded by Wyndale Investments Limited in partnership with Karatapo Resources Limited, a local landowner company in the Eivo-Torau constituency in Central Bougainville.The people of Paruparu have been crying for a road since the Independence of Papua New Guinea in 1975 but their calls were never heard.
The people themselves formed the Karatapo Resources Limited and partnered with investor Wyndale Investments and as part of it’s social obligation, the investor made a commitment to build a road to reach one of Bougainville’s most remote areas.Project engineer Lawrence Nohu told the Post-Courier that the road is currently being constructed by Dekenai Construction and they have covered much of the area already. The road was previously constructed by the then Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL).“BCL constructed the road from the main Siwai-Nagovis highway right up to the Kuraro river. We have so far maintained the road they have built right up to where they stopped, right up to the Bato bridge which is the longest bridge on Bougainville. That’s 16.7km and then right up here to the Kuraro river its now 24.5km,” Mr Nohu said.
“Right now we will be constructing a new road in unchartered territory a place where there has never been a road before. It will be very challenging but we are prepared to take on the challenge for this next 12km.”Meanwhile, Karatapo Resources Ltd chairman, Jullian Jaavi thanked all stakeholders for their time and support for making the road project a success.“As chairman of Karatapo Ltd, I would like to thank first of all our investor, Wyndale Investments Ltd, Dekenai Construction, the people of Paruparu and the people of the Bolave constituency where the road runs through for their cooperation,” Mr Jaavi said.
“It’s time we did something on our own instead of waiting for the government to spoon feed us all the time.”

UPNG Journalism StudentRehabilitation work will start on the Wau-Bulolo Highway in Morobe Province as soon as a third independent contractor is engaged, Minister for Works and Highways, Solan Mirisim told Parliament yesterday.Mr Mirisim was responding to Wau-Waria MP Marsh Narewec’s concern raised on the floor about the bad state of the highway that he described as the oldest in the country.
According to Mr Narewec, the 70-year-old Wau-Bulolo highway was constructed by Australians after World War Two.“It (Wau-Bulolo highway) has served this country before Independence, during Independence and continues to serve the country today.“It contributes to the economy of the country and is second only to the Highlands Highway,” he said.
Narewec also informed Parliament that commitment was made in 2021 by Prime Minister James Marape and late member for Bulolo Sam Basil but no work has started yet.“Now I want to ask the good Minister for Works and Highway, can he tell the people of Wau-Waria why are we being neglected or have missed out in this rehabilitation program?”In response, Mr Mirisim said: “The delay is due to the distance of the road so we have decided to put out tender for a 3rd contractor who will start the road work from Bulolo to Wau to fast track the road construction.
“I want assure the member for Wau-Waria and his people that this year under Connect PNG we will put out a tender for the road rehabilitation starting from Bulolo to Wau.”The road program is funded by AusAid and the PNG government where two contractors have already been engaged, one is based at 9-Mile and the other in Wau, according to Mr Mirisim.He said because it was a counterpart funding arrangement, the full road construction from Bulolo to Wau would start once funds were released this year.The Wau-Bulolo Highway begins at 9-Mile, Huon Gulf district, and ends in Wau in the Wau-Waria district.

The K117 million four-lane road from 9 Mile to Pacific Adventist University was finally launched yesterday and will open doors for economic growth and connectivity between the people of Central province to the National Capital District.
Prime Minister James Marape and NCD Governor Powes Parkop, along with other members of parliament officially cut the ribbon yesterday afternoon after three years of construction declaring the road open.
Mr Marape said roads in the nation’s capital and all across the country allow for the growth of economy especially for small subsistence farmers who depend on proper road access to take their produce to markets. He urged locals and residents to fully utilise the full potential of this road.
“Roads carries the economy and not the other way around. Road and enabling infrastructures carries the economy and today under the flagship program of the Connect PNG program we are punching roads to places that have never seen roads before and not just the nation’s capital,” stated Mr Marape.
NCD Governor Powes Parkop also highlighted that the road offers an economic corridor for the people of Central province into the city thus connecting the farmers to the market and the city to the educational hub that lies within the 9 mile to 14 mile area.
“This road holds great significance for our city and for our country. It serves a vital artery connecting the commercial part of our city to what I say the educational hub of our city.
“As we witness the completion of this infrastructure project we affirm our commitment to the transformation of Port Moresby to a truly national capital,” he stated.
The four lane road was constructed by a local construction company Mobile Works. The ground breaking ceremony was held in 2020 and it was funded by the BSP Financial Group Limited at the guarantee of the national government.
Furthermore, Prime Minister Marape urged locals along the road to use the road for their economic benefit as well as to take proper care of the road.
“This road must return its investment to the country. I want to ask all our citizens to take ownership of this road. Don’t spit and litter on this road.
“Your government will work to give fines and penalties. It must start in the nation’s capital, live life, drive must be fitting of a modern infrastructure. No time for recklessness,” he warned.
