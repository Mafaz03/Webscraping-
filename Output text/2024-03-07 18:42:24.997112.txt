DRC: Cobalt, Copper, cross-border transport nightmare | Africanews

                                                                    Gaza: President Al-Sisi accuses Israel of blocking delivery of aid
                                                                    Nigeria: Antony Blinken aims to strengthen ties amidst security concerns in the Sahel
                                                                    Ivory Coast's Coach Jean-Louis Gasset sacked after humiliating defeat
The heavy load of copper cathodes is secured, the Howo semi-trailer is ready to travel the 2,000 km or so from the mines in Haut-Katanga to the port of Dar es Salaam, from where the cargo will be shipped to Asia.
"It can take two weeks to make the trip," complains Omar Rachidi Katema, a 57-year-old Tanzanian truck driver who has just loaded 27 tons of copper plate at the Chemaf (Chemicals of Africa) plant at the Etoile mine site in Lubumbashi, in southeastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
"There are a lot of traffic jams, a lot of tolls, a lot of waiting at the border," says the trucker.
The plates (cathodes) are firmly attached in bundles, each weighing 2.3 tons. "To avoid theft" during transport, explains Eric Tshinkobo, copper manager at the plant.
At the London Metal Exchange (LME) price, a ton of copper costs about $10,000.
But if the goods are spared, the drivers are not, especially on the Congolese portion of the route. "Thieves attack us, especially on the Lubumbashi bypass road," says Omar Rachidi.
"Between here and the Zambian border (about 80 km), bandits attack us, rip off the tarpaulins, take away our money," also laments Jacob Daoudi, 45, another Tanzanian trucker, who transports 30 tons of cobalt hydroxide in his Scania.
To avoid drivers carrying too much cash, operators are increasingly resorting to prepayment, via a bank, of the substantial sums to be paid at the toll booths along the road from Kolwezi, another major mining town in neighbouring Lualaba province, to Kasumbalesa, on the border with Zambia.
There are six toll booths along the 400 km of this strategic route," said Lambert Tshisueka Mutondo, president of the international road transporters of Haut-Katanga, affiliated with the Federation of Congolese Companies (FEC). This situation "hinders the flow of traffic and the profitability of the sector", he says.
He also deplores the tariffs charged: to cover these 400 km, heavy goods vehicles pay some 500 dollars, or 1,000 dollars round trip, ten times more expensive on average, according to him, than on the roads of southern Africa.
The tolls on this section are conceded by the Congolese state to a Chinese company which, in return, undertakes to ensure the construction and maintenance of road infrastructure.
The issue is sensitive and regularly debated, with one NGO recently denouncing the "leonine" nature of this type of contract. The Congolese Association for Access to Justice (Acaj) was surprised that after 14 years of concessions, the DRC still does not have a highway.
The government firmly disputes this analysis and asserts that these concessions, which it wants to extend, have enabled the construction and rehabilitation of many roads.
Compared to the average state of the Congolese road network, National Road 1, which crosses "greater Katanga", is good, paved and without deep potholes. But it has only two lanes, one for each direction of traffic.
Upstream of the Kanyaka tollbooth, halfway between Lubumbashi and the border, more than 200 semi-trailers are at a standstill, waiting to complete the mandatory formalities.
"In the Congo, there are red tape all the time," says Maniasi Djuma Makweba, 50, also on his way to Dar es Salaam with 35 tons of cobalt loaded at TFM (Tenke Fungurume Mining), 300 km away.
Like the other drivers, he complains about thieves, but also about the military and police. "When you go to the police to report a theft, they start by trying to extort money from you," the trucker says.
The Upper Katanga transporters' guild is calling for "patrols to deter criminals", as well as for the number of toll booths to be halved, for prices to be "capped according to the distance to be covered" and "harmonized" between the DRC and neighboring Zambia.
In fact, "by reciprocity", Zambia makes Congolese trucks pay a high price when crossing its territory and thus loses all competitiveness to South African, Zimbabwean or Tanzanian transporters. "For several years, international transport in our province has been the prerogative of foreign companies," deplores its president.
The DRC is the world's largest producer of cobalt and Africa's largest producer of copper.

Algeria partners China for construction of 6,000km railway lines 
                                                      Railway line
                                                                                    -  
China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the "best guarantee of development", stressing that "our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km." The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
"China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner," said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
"The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth," he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
"As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities," said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
"This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone," echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

"The purpose of my visit is obviously to mark the concrete launch of the completion of major infrastructure projects here in Abidjan. " Le Maire said in Abidjan.
"The metro is one of the largest infrastructure projects on the continent. It is an ambitious project, a social project that will benefit millions of people in Abidjan" the French minister added.
At the end of 2019, a French consortium comprising the groups Bouygues Travaux Publics, Alstom, Colas Rail and Keolis had been chosen to build the first metro line in Abidjan.
At the time, France committed to cover the contract with a mix of loans from the French Treasury and private financing guaranteed by the French government. The cost of the work is estimated at 1.36 billion euros. The line will cross the Ivorian metropolis from north to south over 37 km, as far as the airport. The construction work has been delayed for years, but the government hopes that the metro will be operational by 2025.

It's a road that will link six African nations, improving transport and delivering high-speed internet across the continent. And at In Guezzam, on the border between Algeria and Niger, the last section of what's been called the African Unity Road is nearing completion.
Conceived over 50 years ago, the Trans-Saharan Highway runs almost 5,000 kilometres from Algiers to Lagos in Nigeria. Its goal is to strengthen regional integration and promote trade between the north and south of the Sahara.
An artery for Algeria"The Trans-Saharan is an economic artery for Algeria in the framework of free trade," says Fayçal Amrouche, Wali of In-Guezzam. "First and foremost it will bring economic benefits and also social benefits for the whole population, which is expecting a lot from it.
"Overall, the residents of In-Guezzam are pleased with this seven-kilometre stretch of road, which is the last section of the African Unity Road on the border with Niger," adds Brahim Ben Khia, President of the Popular Assembly in the Wilaya of In-Guezzam. "It's a construction that's built to international standards."
The RN1 is the main artery between Europe and North Africa. Without the RN1, we're done for!
From Saharan dunes to high plateaus to the capital Algiers, National Road 1, as it's known in Algeria, crosses the country in all its diversity and links remote areas, such as Tamanrasset, the historic meeting place of nomadic caravans, and still a commercial hub, 1900 kilometres from Algiers.
"The Wilaya of Tamanrasset is a crossroads of all African civilisations," says Noureddine Guellal, Director Of Public Works and Wilaya of Tamanrasset. "Barter transactions have increased in recent years. The list of products to be exported and imported is revised each year according to our needs and those of our neighbours."
To cope with this influx, existing sections are being modernised. Following technical studies which took into account the difficult Saharan conditions, their load capacity and width are being increased to ensure safe passage for trucks.
"The RN1 is the main artery between Europe and North Africa," says truck driver Louzri Abderrezak. "Without the RN1, we're done for!"

Internet Cable BackboneBut it's not just roads that connect people. There's also the internet. This road is lined with thousands of kilometres of cable as part of another multinational project: the Trans-Saharan Fibre Optic Backbone.
These technical centres maintain the bandwidth, which has almost doubled over the past two years.
"These are the incoming fibre strands of the trans-Saharan backbone," Bilel Bouglouf, Director Of Post And Telecommunications in the Wilaya Of Tamanrasset, show me. "Their exit towards the borders is through here. Thanks to this trans-Saharan fibre optic backbone, there's the same internet speed in Algiers as in Tamanrasset."
The arrival of fibre optics has enabled the creation of digital schools. This has had a huge impact on pupils' education.

The Internet is changing daily life in this large southern city. Credit cards are becoming more widely used in shops. In schools, touch-screen tablets are given to students to encourage creativity and autonomy.
"The arrival of fibre optics has enabled the creation of digital schools," says Ibtissem Merahi, Director of the Abdelkrim El Meghili Primary Boarding School. "This has had a huge impact on pupils' education."
Algeria has completed its part of the fibre optic backbone, more than 2,500 kilometres from Algiers towards Mauritania to a central hub on the border with Niger.
Six African countries are members of the project, which is intended to offer a cheaper alternative to satellite solutions.
"This project will also enable access to the international market for countries that have no coastline, no access to the sea and no submarine cable," says Mourad El-Allia Secretary General Trans-Saharan Liaison Committee. "It allows start-ups and innovation to emerge, and also allows women to showcase their work. It also enables distance learning. It allows us to contribute to the digital development of our African nations."
Another major cooperation project could see the light of day on the same axis: a trans-Saharan gas pipeline between Nigeria and Algeria via Niger.

Kenya: Sand harvestings' dire impact on rivers and aquatic life 
                                                      Sand excavators in Kenya
                                                                                    -  
It's hard to believe that a river flowed through this land in Kenya's Machakos County.
It's just over a hundred miles from the capital Nairobi with its demands as a growing city.
Construction, the need to make glass, cement, concrete and a host of everyday items is what leads the workers and their lorries here.
But the constant excavation of sand n is threatening the environment.
These teams of sand excavators say they are aware of the problem, but there is no system to help them manage the harvesting sustainably.
He says he and others have seen the devastation caused by uncontrolled sand harvesting.
"For our sand, sometimes we excavate to the detriment of our grazing areas, leading to our animals lacking water, but if the government can construct sand catchments so that we can have watering and grazing areas, put regulations where we are supposed to pass while carrying sand and restrict others and construct good roads, it will be a good move," says Mutisya.
"The sand carried from these rivers in a day is in hundreds and thousands of tons because an average semi-trailer can carry 50 tons, (but) there are those for 30 tons and one like mine which is 15 tons. So in a day, it's hard to know the exact (amount) but it's thousands of tons," he adds.
Halinish Yusuf is the Sand Conservation and Utilization Director at Makueni County.
She believes there is a clear need to regulate the industry and to carry out studies to discover whether the resources they have in terms of sand can meet the growing demands.
"Because of the strategic importance of sand being the second most extracted natural resource after water and the importance because of the modernization that is going on, demand from the construction industry, demand from the glass industry and many other industries, there is a need to start thinking about regulating it, recycling, regulating where its harvested, how its harvested, but also thinking about alternatives and also thinking about upscaling and monitoring how its harvested, where, the amounts we have so that we start planning for the future," says Yusuf.
In Kiambu County, a new construction site requires more building materials.
The groundbreaking ceremony to mark a new housing project is cause for celebration, but it could have detrimental consequences for the environment from which the sand is being excavated.
Many rivers in this part of Kenya are bare, and only huge protruding rocks remain.
Lorries excavating sand runs on almost a 24-hour cycle to supply building sites like this one in Kiambu.
Site engineer Samuel Waweru of Vimika Construction has to turn this 20-acre site into a block of residential apartments in the next 18 months.
He argues the regulation of sand supply is a government issue, but he says his crews will also be able to use the rocks to make the necessary building materials.
"About the river sand we don't have data on how much sand is being used but it is in huge figures in terms of millions of tons. In the future because of the environment, we have seen some counties prohibit sand harvesting but in case of sand is prohibited, we have an alternative where we can use rock sand. Rock sand we get it from the ballast, when we are crushing the ballast the byproduct is rock sand which is recommended to use as a substitute for river sand," he says.
According to a recent report by the United Nations Environment Programe (UNEP) sand is the second-largest exploited resource after water.
It says globally, 50 billion tons of sand and gravel are harvested every year.
The conservation group WWF says: "sand mining is already putting unprecedented pressure on rivers, floodplains and deltas," leading to erosion, biodiversity loss and reduced protection from storm surges.
Many communities in Kenya depend on this sort of excavation as their only source of income and as a consequence in some regions, uncontrolled harvesting has led to environmental damage which has been largely overlooked.
According to Yusuf, there needs to be an inventory to understand how much sand is left, what damage has been done and what the demands of the industry will be in the coming years.
She says: "Unfortunately, there is no data to show how much sand is going to be demanded in future development, and by the same token there is hardly any research on the amount of sand deposits that we have. And so, there is, even as we make plans, development plans as governments, we are not able to tell how much sand will be required and if we are running into a crisis or not and so, there is a need to invest in research, to know how much sand deposits we have, how much can be harvested, and how much is needed for development."
Mutisya is aware that his livelihood is already going to have an impact on the supply of water to his family because as the sand disappears and the ground heads underground water supplies are depleted.
He says: "We are saying if the government puts in structures, we will be ready to comply with those restrictions because in doing so we will conserve water for our livestock and even for our own consumption, so that there is a restricted area so that we can conserve the water because we are headed to a very dry season where we will be forced to buy water, even for our livestock."

                                                      Aerial view of construction work on the Kinshasa financial center in the Gombe district
                                                                                    -  
The people of Kinshasa cannot believe the speed at which a Turkish company has built an imposing financial complex in the heart of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, more accustomed to major Chinese projects than to these new builders of the African continent.
“It’s changed suddenly,” notes a street vendor with a laugh, who has been forced for a little over a year to move his goods as the perimeter of the construction site changes. “They work day and night, even faster than the Chinese,” adds a security agent, somewhat admiringly.
In February 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an official visit to the DRC, his umpteenth trip to Africa. Under his leadership, Ankara has invested a lot in the continent over the past two decades, to develop diplomatic but also economic ties.
Turkish companies have, for example, built a mosque in Ghana, stadiums in Rwanda or Senegal, and airports in several countries.
In Kinshasa, he concluded cooperation agreements concerning in particular security, defense and the construction of infrastructure, including the "Finance Center" whose work was quickly launched, in a concession located near the Turkish school, in the business commune of Gombe.
There was at this place, between the courthouse and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a roundabout pompously called Place de l'Independance, decorated with a sort of faded cement platform carried by stairs leading to no monument.
Visitors sometimes walked there, between the rows of plants in small bags bought by the occupants of the villas with gardens built in the area during the time of the Belgian settlers. Then the palisades and construction bungalows appeared, quickly dominated by half a dozen concrete towers gradually covered with glass panels.
Two of them, around twenty floors high, will house the Ministries of Finance and Budget. The complex, which includes nine buildings in total, will also house a convention center, offices, a large hotel, etc.
The prime contractor is the company Milvest, a subsidiary of the Turkish holding company Miller. According to its CEO Turhan Mildon, who gave a press briefing on the site in mid-September, this project will have employed some 3,000 people - 1,800 Congolese and 1,200 Turks.
The cost of the work is estimated at $290 million, pre-financed by the company, which is also investing $60 million in the hotel which it will manage for 49 years. The finance center is scheduled to be inaugurated on December 2. Before the elections scheduled for the 20th of the same month, in which the current president Félix Tshisekedi is a candidate for a second term.
With its dusty scaffolding, the construction site very close to the new Chinese embassy seems almost to be stalling, and the Chinese workers no longer have the attraction of novelty among the Congolese.
Very present in the country since the time of Mobutu Sese Seko (1965-97), they built the "People's Palace" , the seat of Parliament, and the Martyrs Stadium, an immense enclosure with 80,000 seats.
Under Joseph Kabila (2001-2019), under the terms of a mega-contract "mines for infrastructure", they rebuilt and enlarged large avenues, including the boulevard du 30 Juin, which looks like a highway in the middle of the city. Under Félix Tshisekedi, they continue to build, among other things, a gigantic cultural complex currently nearing completion.
But against them, Turkey is advancing its pawns. In addition to the financial center, the Milvest company is in the running for the renovation and extension of Kinshasa airport, a project initially awarded to a Chinese company but not completed.
The construction of an urban cable car is also planned in an outlying, hilly, and congested area of ​​Kinshasa, for which Milvest is in contract with the French company Poma, a cable transport specialist.
This project, still in its administrative phase, particularly intrigues the inhabitants of Kinshasa, a chaotic city of 15 million souls where electricity and running water are rare commodities in certain neighborhoods.

                                                                                    -  
The people of Kinshasa cannot believe the speed at which a Turkish company has built an imposing financial complex in the heart of the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, more accustomed to major Chinese projects than to these new builders of the African continent.
“It’s changed suddenly,” notes a street vendor with a laugh, who has been forced for a little over a year to move his goods as the perimeter of the construction site changes. “They work day and night, even faster than the Chinese,” adds a security agent, somewhat admiringly.
In February 2022, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an official visit to the DRC, his umpteenth trip to Africa. Under his leadership, Ankara has invested a lot in the continent over the past two decades, to develop diplomatic but also economic ties.
Turkish companies have, for example, built a mosque in Ghana, stadiums in Rwanda or Senegal, and airports in several countries.
In Kinshasa, he concluded cooperation agreements concerning in particular security, defense and the construction of infrastructure, including the "Finance Center" whose work was quickly launched, in a concession located near the Turkish school, in the business commune of Gombe.
There was at this place, between the courthouse and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a roundabout pompously called Place de l'Independance, decorated with a sort of faded cement platform carried by stairs leading to no monument.
Visitors sometimes walked there, between the rows of plants in small bags bought by the occupants of the villas with gardens built in the area during the time of the Belgian settlers. Then the palisades and construction bungalows appeared, quickly dominated by half a dozen concrete towers gradually covered with glass panels.
Two of them, around twenty floors high, will house the Ministries of Finance and Budget. The complex, which includes nine buildings in total, will also house a convention center, offices, a large hotel, etc.
The prime contractor is the company Milvest, a subsidiary of the Turkish holding company Miller. According to its CEO Turhan Mildon, who gave a press briefing on the site in mid-September, this project will have employed some 3,000 people - 1,800 Congolese and 1,200 Turks.
The cost of the work is estimated at $290 million, pre-financed by the company, which is also investing $60 million in the hotel which it will manage for 49 years. The finance center is scheduled to be inaugurated on December 2. Before the elections scheduled for the 20th of the same month, in which the current president Félix Tshisekedi is a candidate for a second term.
With its dusty scaffolding, the construction site very close to the new Chinese embassy seems almost to be stalling, and the Chinese workers no longer have the attraction of novelty among the Congolese.
Very present in the country since the time of Mobutu Sese Seko (1965-97), they built the "People's Palace" , the seat of Parliament, and the Martyrs Stadium, an immense enclosure with 80,000 seats.
Under Joseph Kabila (2001-2019), under the terms of a mega-contract "mines for infrastructure", they rebuilt and enlarged large avenues, including the boulevard du 30 Juin, which looks like a highway in the middle of the city. Under Félix Tshisekedi, they continue to build, among other things, a gigantic cultural complex currently nearing completion.
But against them, Turkey is advancing its pawns. In addition to the financial center, the Milvest company is in the running for the renovation and extension of Kinshasa airport, a project initially awarded to a Chinese company but not completed.
The construction of an urban cable car is also planned in an outlying, hilly, and congested area of ​​Kinshasa, for which Milvest is in contract with the French company Poma, a cable transport specialist.
This project, still in its administrative phase, particularly intrigues the inhabitants of Kinshasa, a chaotic city of 15 million souls where electricity and running water are rare commodities in certain neighborhoods.

At least five people were missing Wednesday in the centre of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) the day after the collapse of a bridge which gave way to the passage of a truck, we learned from concordant sources.
According to witnesses, the Lovua bridge, over the river of the same name, gave way when the truck, too heavily laden with construction materials, crossed it on its way to Tshikapa, the capital of Kasai province.
"The truck had ten people on board. One of them refused to cross on board this machine but the others were stubborn", explained the head of the sector where the accident occurred, Hubert Mbombo.
According to him, the truck with its nine occupants, as well as the bridge, which had been badly damaged for several years, fell into the river. The bodies of the victims have not been found.
Guy Mafuta, MP for Kasaï, meanwhile put the number of missing at seven and the vice-governor, Gaston Nkole, at five – two men, a woman and two children. According to Mr Nkole, interviewed by AFP, the vehicle was carrying some 30 tons of cement and stones, while the bridge was designed to support 10 to 15 tons.
The collapse of road bridges, in poor condition and used by heavy loads are frequent in the DRC, especially during the rainy season.

Ex- Assembly member in court for not constructing funded road project | Ghana News Agency

Ex- Assembly member in court for not constructing funded road project
Accra, Feb. 27, GNA- Nii Armah Ashitey a former Assembly member, who was allegedly given GHC500,000 by a foundation to construct road and drainage but failed has appeared before an Accra Circuit Court.
Ashitey. a former assembly member for Adobetor electoral area in La Dadekotpon Municipality, has been charged with defrauding by false pretences, using public office for profit, money laundering.
The 63-year-old former assembly member has pleaded not guilty to the various charges.
Ashiety is said to have told the Police that he used the money for “mobilization of the project” but could not provide documents and receipts to that effect.
The court presided over by Mr Isaac Addo has admitted Ashitey to bail in the sum of GHC500,000 with two sureties.
Prosecution led by Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Seth Frimpong said the complainants, Maxwell Ahugah and Mrs Naomi Vogel were manager and director, respectively of Robert Vogel Memorial Foundation.
ASP Frimpong said the accused person was a resident of La Wireless.
Prosecution said somewhere in the month of May 2018, Robert Vogel Foundation Memorial, a non-profit organization, engaged in philanthropic activities within the Community, decided to construct a road and drainage as part of their community development at Adobetor electoral area.
According to prosecution, the construction of the projects took place during Ashitey’s tenure as an assembly member of La Dadekotopon Municipal Assembly.
The prosecutor said Ashitey was approached by the Director and Manager of the Robert Vogel Memorial Foundation about their desire to construct a particular road with its attached drainage.
Prosecution said the accused person took advantage of the gesture and presented to the complainants, Bill of Quantities on a number of roads and drains that the assembly had earmarked to construct.
The court heard that Ashitey deceived the Director Mrs Naomi Vogel of the said Foundation to transfer GHC500,000 into his personal account with La Community Bank which he presented as the Municipal Assembly ‘s account.
Again, prosecution said the accused person “deceived the foundation manager and director into believing that the construction of the selected road and drains at Adobetor area had been done with the funds from the Foundation.
Prosecution said the accused person, however, failed to undertake the construction which he claimed he had the capacity to undertake.
The prosecutor said on April 11, 2023, Ashitey was arrested and during interrogation, he told the Police that he “used all the GHC500,000 to do mobilization of the project”.
Prosecution said during investigations, the accused person was given the opportunity to furnish the Police with receipts or documents to know how the funds were disbursed for the “mobilization but he could not provide any document or receipts.”
ASP Frimpong said the Police visited the area where the construction should have been done and it was observed that the road had not been constructed and no drainage was done.
“Investigations revealed that accused person simply made this representation which he knew were false to obtain the consent of the manager and the director of the foundation to part with the GHC500,000 and he has since misappropriated the said amount with no effort or ability to construct the road,” prosecution said.
The prosecutor said it was also established that by the accused person’s status as someone who held office as elected assembly member for Adobetor electoral area, he was a public officer.

Agric Minister cuts sod for construction of farm infrastructure projects   | Ghana News Agency

Agric Minister cuts sod for construction of farm infrastructure projects  
Accra, Feb 20, GNA — Dr. Bryan Acheampong, Minister of Food and Agriculture, has cut the sod for the construction of farm infrastructure for smallholder farmers in Kwasi Fante, Afram Plains South District, Eastern Region. 
The project, which is under the Emergency Support to Rural Livelihoods and Food Systems exposed to COVID-19 (ESRF), includes the construction of farm tracks (roads), water harvesting schemes, drying platforms, and boreholes.  
It aims to enhance the lives of smallholder farmers by providing better access to markets, addressing water scarcity, increasing crop yields, and improving post-harvest management.  
It is supported by the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD). 
Speaking at the sod-cutting ceremony over the weekend, Dr Acheampong said building robust agriculture infrastructure was critical to improving farm yields and achieving food security for the country. 
In that regard, he said, the government was embarking on a massive infrastructure development in the agriculture sector, disclosing that, about 100-hectare water harvesting schemes would be constructed for smallholder farmers in Tordzinu, South Tongu District, and Klenormadi, Ketu District, in the Volta Region.  
Additionally, he said, 16 commodity drying platforms would be built, and 29.5 kilometres of farm tracks would be constructed in various regions. 
“Furthermore, 20 boreholes will be installed in the North-East Gonja, Nanton, Atebubu, Bono East, Northern, and Savannah regions,” he added. 
Dr Acheampong said the projects, when completed, would impact smallholder farmers and beneficiary communities, stating that they would be better equipped to face challenges posed by climate change.  
The Minister urged contractors undertaking the projects to adhere to the highest construction standards and avoid shoddy work to ensure that the projects lasted a lifetime 
He thanked IFAD for its assistance in making the projects feasible and called for collective action to transform the agricultural sector and contribute to Ghana’s economic growth. 
Dr Hayford Baah-Adade, the Programme Coordinator for ESRF, said that the projects would support smallholder farmers and beneficiary communities impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.  
He said that the initiative aimed to achieve three key goals: protect against hunger and build resilient livelihoods; safeguard rural marketing linkages and food security; and project management, monitoring, and evaluation. 
He assured the Minister of delivering quality work, indicating that the contractors had been selected based on their expertise and successful track records in executing such infrastructure projects.  
Dr. Baah-Adade urged supervising agencies, such as the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), the Department of Feeder Roads (DFR), and the Community Water and Sanitation Agency (CWSA), to be accountable for providing effective supervision and monitoring project progress to ensure quality and timely delivery of projects.

PIAC begins oil-funded project inspections for 2024  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Accra, Jan 21, GNA – The Public Interest and Accountability Committee (PIAC) has begun the year with the inspection of public infrastructure projects funded with petroleum revenues. 
The committee undertook a simultaneous inspection in the Greater Accra and Central Regions based on information provided by the Ministry of Finance on projects and the accompanying disbursements of petroleum revenues through the Annual Budget Funding Amount (ABFA). 
The exercise was in line with PIAC’s mandate of conducting independent assessment of the management and use of petroleum revenues to ensure maximum impact. 
A PIAC team in Accra was led by the Chair, Emerita Professor Elizabeth Ardayfio-Schandorf and by officials of the Department of Urban Roads of the Ministry of Roads and Highways, and the Ledzokuku Municipal Assembly in some project sites at Teshie and Spintex.  
They were the rehabilitation of selected roads in Teshie Camp, Southern Command and Mats (now Ghana Military Academy), the Construction of the 7.5-kilometre Teshie Link.  Teshie Link, and the Construction of a Flyover over the Tema Motorway from the Flowerpot roundabout.  
These three (3) projects, located in the Ledzokuku Municipality are at different stages of progress and received funds from the ABFA between 2019 and 2022.  
The Team toured the rehabilitated roads, a car park, and a parade ground within the Southern Command in Teshie.  
Information available to PIAC showed that the contract for this project was awarded on July 13, 2020 and was supposed to have been completed within 24 months.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project was 24% physically complete. Out of the total contract sum of GH¢145.82 million, petroleum revenue of GH¢7.39 million, representing 5.07 per cent, was disbursed to the project in 2022.  
The second project inspected by the team was the construction of the 7.5-kilometre Teshie Link.  
It involved the construction of a new road and drainage structures with earthworks and asphaltic concrete surfacing.  
Awarded on 18th October 2019, the project had an original contract duration of 18 months.  
Out of the original contract sum of GH¢87.88 million petroleum revenue of GH¢29.73 million, representing 33.84 per cent was disbursed to the project from 2019 to 2021.  
The PIAC Team was informed that the Teshie Link Road is a dual carriageway that commences in the South on the Accra-Tema coastal road, through the LEKMA Hospital, and terminates on the Spintex Road.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, 95% of all drainage works had been completed, and asphaltic binder and wearing course laid on the road.  
The team was informed that the contractor had suspended work due to non-payment of funds. 
Outstanding works include the installation of traffic signals and road markings to show a controlled intersection.  
The absence of these had resulted in several vehicle crashes in the area.  
The third project was the construction of a flyover over the Tema Motorway, from the Flowerpot roundabout.  
Out of the revised contract sum of GH¢284,665,639.27, a total of GH¢141,093,766.84 representing 49.56 per cent, was disbursed from the ABFA in 2022.  
The project is located at the Flowerpot Roundabout, Spintex and East Legon, and involves creating access from the Motorway to the Boundary Road roundabout and an exit into Cantonments from the Giffard Road Interchange.  
It consists of one mainline bridge, two ramp bridges, four auxiliary roads, and ancillary works. At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project had made physical progress of 70%.  
In the Central Region, the PIAC Team, led by Nana Kweku Dei, a member representing the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College, a 90-bed Hostel Block at Saltpond, and an irrigation infrastructure at Mprumem. 
Accompanied by officials of the Mfantseman Municipal Assembly, the team inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College Project, which had received an amount of GH¢9,507,111.52 from the ABFA from 2012 to 2022.  
The project comprises an 18-Unit Classroom Block, Hostel facility, Administration Block, and a Laboratory.  
Since the Committee’s last visit to the project in 2020, the construction of a teachers’ bungalow has started, and a road contract has been awarded.  
The 4.6km road project, which starts within the campus and ends at the main Accra-Cape Coast highway, is currently at Phase 1 (Sub-base).  
The road contract, originally valued at GH¢8 million has been through three (3) variation orders and is currently valued at approximately GH¢27 million, primarily due to payment delays.  
The Committee also notes that the hostel facility and the 18-unit classroom block had not been fitted with beds and study desks, respectively.  
Also, the laboratory, classroom block and hostel facilities had developed structural defects at the time of PIAC’s inspection. 
In line with the Committee’s policy of visiting projects that have received funding from the ABFA and have been completed, the team inspected a 90-bed Hostel Block for the Ghana Education Service Development Institute (GESDI) at Saltpond.  
The project had received an amount of GH¢1,456,960.92 from the ABFA in 2015. GESDI is a Ghana Education Service (GES) Centre for capacity building in education-related programmes and seminars.  
The project was commissioned in 2020 with a 90-bed capacity hostel block, four (4) washrooms, two conference halls and a 100-person capacity cafeteria.  
The Committee was satisfied with the overall quality of the project.  
Accompanied by the Central Regional Manager of the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), the team inspected a third project, which was the development of an irrigation infrastructure at Mprumem.  
The project received GH¢45.078 million from the ABFA from 2017 to 2020. The irrigation project, which was started in 2015, overlaps the Gomoa Central and Gomoa West Districts.  
It comprises a reservoir area; which stores water from River Bushen for irrigation, and the developed area; which has 70 hectares of irrigable land.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project (now known as the Mprumem Irrigation Scheme) had been completed and was in use by farmers in the vicinity for vegetable farming. 
Across all the projects visited, the issue of delayed payments to contractors was noted. 
The release of funds for the projects to progress uninterruptedly was highlighted by the contractors at the various sites.  
PIAC believes that the co-mingling of petroleum revenues with other funds for projects that end up getting stalled for a long period does not reflect the prudent use of revenues for impact.  
The Committee therefore urged the government to consider channelling adequate petroleum revenues to complete earmarked projects going forward. 
After the inspection in Accra, the Chair of the Committee expressed concern about the paltry sums of petroleum revenues allocated to some ongoing infrastructure projects in the country.  
She noted that the allocated funds, which are channelled to these projects through the Annual Budget Funding Amount, did not indicate significant contributions to the total funds of these projects.  
PIAC, she said, would continue to make its case for more prudent use of the country’s petroleum revenues, to ensure that enough funds were committed to complete earmarked projects.  
Emerita Professor Ardayfio-Schandorf expressed gratitude to the Assembly Officials and stakeholders who contributed to the success of the inspections.  
The Committee remains committed to the promotion of transparency and accountability in the management of the country’s petroleum revenues,  
as enshrined in the Petroleum Revenue Management Act (PRMA), 2011 as amended.

Information available to PIAC showed that the contract for this project was awarded on July 13, 2020 and was supposed to have been completed within 24 months.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project was 24% physically complete. Out of the total contract sum of GH¢145.82 million, petroleum revenue of GH¢7.39 million, representing 5.07 per cent, was disbursed to the project in 2022.  
The second project inspected by the team was the construction of the 7.5-kilometre Teshie Link.  
It involved the construction of a new road and drainage structures with earthworks and asphaltic concrete surfacing.  
Awarded on 18th October 2019, the project had an original contract duration of 18 months.  
Out of the original contract sum of GH¢87.88 million petroleum revenue of GH¢29.73 million, representing 33.84 per cent was disbursed to the project from 2019 to 2021.  
The PIAC Team was informed that the Teshie Link Road is a dual carriageway that commences in the South on the Accra-Tema coastal road, through the LEKMA Hospital, and terminates on the Spintex Road.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, 95% of all drainage works had been completed, and asphaltic binder and wearing course laid on the road.  
The team was informed that the contractor had suspended work due to non-payment of funds. 
Outstanding works include the installation of traffic signals and road markings to show a controlled intersection.  
The absence of these had resulted in several vehicle crashes in the area.  
The third project was the construction of a flyover over the Tema Motorway, from the Flowerpot roundabout.  
Out of the revised contract sum of GH¢284,665,639.27, a total of GH¢141,093,766.84 representing 49.56 per cent, was disbursed from the ABFA in 2022.  
The project is located at the Flowerpot Roundabout, Spintex and East Legon, and involves creating access from the Motorway to the Boundary Road roundabout and an exit into Cantonments from the Giffard Road Interchange.  
It consists of one mainline bridge, two ramp bridges, four auxiliary roads, and ancillary works. At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project had made physical progress of 70%.  
In the Central Region, the PIAC Team, led by Nana Kweku Dei, a member representing the Ghana Journalists Association (GJA), inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College, a 90-bed Hostel Block at Saltpond, and an irrigation infrastructure at Mprumem. 
Accompanied by officials of the Mfantseman Municipal Assembly, the team inspected the Anomabo Fisheries College Project, which had received an amount of GH¢9,507,111.52 from the ABFA from 2012 to 2022.  
The project comprises an 18-Unit Classroom Block, Hostel facility, Administration Block, and a Laboratory.  
Since the Committee’s last visit to the project in 2020, the construction of a teachers’ bungalow has started, and a road contract has been awarded.  
The 4.6km road project, which starts within the campus and ends at the main Accra-Cape Coast highway, is currently at Phase 1 (Sub-base).  
The road contract, originally valued at GH¢8 million has been through three (3) variation orders and is currently valued at approximately GH¢27 million, primarily due to payment delays.  
The Committee also notes that the hostel facility and the 18-unit classroom block had not been fitted with beds and study desks, respectively.  
Also, the laboratory, classroom block and hostel facilities had developed structural defects at the time of PIAC’s inspection. 
In line with the Committee’s policy of visiting projects that have received funding from the ABFA and have been completed, the team inspected a 90-bed Hostel Block for the Ghana Education Service Development Institute (GESDI) at Saltpond.  
The project had received an amount of GH¢1,456,960.92 from the ABFA in 2015. GESDI is a Ghana Education Service (GES) Centre for capacity building in education-related programmes and seminars.  
The project was commissioned in 2020 with a 90-bed capacity hostel block, four (4) washrooms, two conference halls and a 100-person capacity cafeteria.  
The Committee was satisfied with the overall quality of the project.  
Accompanied by the Central Regional Manager of the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA), the team inspected a third project, which was the development of an irrigation infrastructure at Mprumem.  
The project received GH¢45.078 million from the ABFA from 2017 to 2020. The irrigation project, which was started in 2015, overlaps the Gomoa Central and Gomoa West Districts.  
It comprises a reservoir area; which stores water from River Bushen for irrigation, and the developed area; which has 70 hectares of irrigable land.  
At the time of PIAC’s visit, the project (now known as the Mprumem Irrigation Scheme) had been completed and was in use by farmers in the vicinity for vegetable farming. 
Across all the projects visited, the issue of delayed payments to contractors was noted. 
The release of funds for the projects to progress uninterruptedly was highlighted by the contractors at the various sites.  
PIAC believes that the co-mingling of petroleum revenues with other funds for projects that end up getting stalled for a long period does not reflect the prudent use of revenues for impact.  
The Committee therefore urged the government to consider channelling adequate petroleum revenues to complete earmarked projects going forward. 
After the inspection in Accra, the Chair of the Committee expressed concern about the paltry sums of petroleum revenues allocated to some ongoing infrastructure projects in the country.  
She noted that the allocated funds, which are channelled to these projects through the Annual Budget Funding Amount, did not indicate significant contributions to the total funds of these projects.  
PIAC, she said, would continue to make its case for more prudent use of the country’s petroleum revenues, to ensure that enough funds were committed to complete earmarked projects.  
Emerita Professor Ardayfio-Schandorf expressed gratitude to the Assembly Officials and stakeholders who contributed to the success of the inspections.  
The Committee remains committed to the promotion of transparency and accountability in the management of the country’s petroleum revenues,  
as enshrined in the Petroleum Revenue Management Act (PRMA), 2011 as amended.

‘Oxygen City Road’, other projects take off in Ho   | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Ho, Jan. 14, GNA – Works have begun on a 1.2-kilometre road in the Ho Municipality that connects to the Aflao highway in the Volta Region, under the Ghana Secondary Cities Support Programme.  
 Mr Divine Bosson, the Ho Municipal Chief Executive (MCE), told the media during a tour of the project, that the road, known as the (Oxygen City Street), would open up many fast-growing communities in the area. 
“The Oxygen City Street will give meaning to the oxygen city concept. It will have a two-sided drain and we will demonstrate the environmental concept with trees etc.” 
The project is being undertaken by Messrs First Sky, and, when completed, would enable works on a major bridge across the south-bound highway to progress. 
The MCE showed the press some wrongly cited buildings obstructing the road project and said all those buildings would be pulled down. 
The team, comprising planners and engineers from the Assembly, inspected works on other roads including a popular alternative route to the market, informally named the “scrap road.” 
Work is also expected to be completed on a bridge connecting the Ho Central Market, the neglect of which had seen several demonstrations to draw attention to its completion. 
A short strategic road in the heart of town, which had been sealed off with unauthorised buildings, is also being constructed. 
The MCE had taken the initiative to open up the road and several others like it in the Municipality, when he assumed office. 
Mr Bosson said more than two kilometres of roads would be completed within nine months for GHC6.6 million sourced from the Third Installment of the World Bank’s Urban Development Grant. 
Roads in the central market would also be upgraded, he said and reminded traders there to free up the curbs for the works to commence.

Accra-Kumasi Highway Dualisation: Road Minister inspects progress of four by-passes 
Konongo (Ash), Jan. 04, GNA – Mr Kwasi Amoako -Atta, Minister for Roads, and Highways, has expressed satisfaction about the progress of work on the four by-passes currently under construction, as part of the Accra-Kumasi highway dualisation project. 
     He applauded all eight contractors working on the projects who are Ghanaian firms for making a strong case for local contractors by delivering quality work. 
       The Minister who was inspecting the projects made up of the Osino by-pass, Anyinam by-pass, Enyiresi by-pass and Konongo by-pass, said local contractors were deliberately selected in line with the Presidents vision to promote local content in project execution. 
      Accompanied by officials of the Ghana Highway Authority (GHA), Mr. Amoako-Atta inspected all four project sites and interacted with the contractors to learn at first hand their challenges and how to address them. 
      The four by-pass projects which are being executed at a cost of GH¢1.9 billion are 45 kilometres in total. 
      The expectation is that, travelling hours and congestion on the central corridor would significantly reduce upon completion of the projects in 30 months, except for the Konongo by-pass, which is scheduled for completion in 36 months. 
      Current work being done at the various sites visited by the Minister are demolishing and site clearing, earth works, culverts and drainage, as well as concrete works. 
      Common challenges confronting the projects as narrated by the contractors included low hanging high tension cables, existing deep galamsay pits, and new galamsay activities in the Birim River. 
      Others are compensation issues and difficulty in getting gravel material because of farms along the stretch. 
      The Minister promised to engage relevant stakeholders to find solutions to the challenges to ensure smooth execution of the projects, saying that the national interest must prevail over all others. 
       “The selection of eight different contractors to handle this project was informed by the fact that we wanted the work to be carried out simultaneously with the same speed,” he pointed out. 
     He stated that, “I keep on saying that President Akuffo Addo’s government for the past seven years has built capacities of local contractors to handle road works of any magnitude in this country.” 
      He said the President promised to continue the dualisation of the Accra-Kumasi highway in 2018 and that he remained committed to redeeming the promise. 
    Government would continue to stand solidly behind local contractors to empower them to play significant role in national development, he assured. 
      He said the government was determined to ensure sustainable funding for the project, allaying fear of the possibility of the project being stalled along the way.

Road accidents; A contributor to disability  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Tamale, Dec 19, GNA- Road accidents are catastrophic in Ghana. Apart from inflicting various degrees of injuries, they have also claimed numerous lives. 
A recent report from the Motor Traffic and Transport Department of the Ghana Police Service indicated that in road crash statistics gathered for the first quarter of 2023, 544 people were killed in various road accidents in the country. 
The statistics also revealed that a total of 3,340 cases were recorded between January to March 2023, a 15.0 per cent reduction compared to the same period in 2022. 
According to the figures, the Greater Accra Region had the highest number of recorded crashes 1,243 among the 16 regions while the Oti Region recorded 15 cases being the least. 
Another report conducted by the Motor Traffic and Transport Department (MTTD) of the Ghana Police Service for July 2023 also revealed that road crashes increased by 4.31 per cent and deaths resulting from road crashes also increased by 30.07 per cent for the period and a total of 1,233 crashes were recorded involving 2,099 vehicles with 186 deaths leaving 1328 persons injured in 2023. 
The report from the Ghana Statistics Research Department indicated that road traffic crashes in Ghana 2021, by region, the country reported 48 cases of road traffic accidents in the Eastern region, which recorded the highest number of road crashes, followed by the Greater Accra and Central regions, each with 43 cases with overall, 240 road accidents were reported in the country on that year. 
There are a multitude of reasons like human mechanical and environmental factors for speeding, overtaking, overloading, reckless driving, fatigue, drunk driving, drugs, not wearing of seat belt and helmet, sleeping when driving, cell phone calls during driving, bad road network. 
Ghana is one of the middle-income countries in which most of the injuries from trauma occur due to carelessness in practising road traffic rules and regulations. 
Road traffic accidents also involve overloading and speeding which have been one of the major causes of road accidents in Ghana, accounting for the higher per cent of cars crashes. 
Statistics from the National Road Safety Commission (NRSC) show that four people die daily on Ghanaian roads and the country loses over 230 million dollars yearly due to road accidents with more than 1600 deaths. 
It stated that the loss correlated to 1.7 percent of the country’s Gross Domestic Product which is affecting National Development. 
Overloaded vehicles and overspeeding on the road, especially freight vehicles, are destroying our road, impacting negatively on economic growth, the damage caused grows exponentially as the load increases. 
Damage to roads as a result of overloading leads and speeding to higher maintenance and repair costs and shortens the life of a road placing an additional burden on the state and law-abiding road users who ultimately carry the costs of careless and inconsiderate overloading. 
Overloading vehicles threaten road safety and are contributing to many of the fatal accidents on roads, and putting the driver and passengers at risk. 
The overloading and speeding of a vehicle can cause the tyres to overheat and wear rapidly which increases the chance of premature, dangerous and expensive failure or blowouts. 
The driver’s control and operating space in the overloaded vehicle are diminished, escalating the chances of an accident. 
The overloaded vehicle cannot accelerate as normal which would make it difficult to overtake. 
At night, the headlights of an overloaded vehicle will tilt up, blinding oncoming drivers to possible debris or obstructions on the roadway. 
The brakes have to work hard due to the riding of brakes and because the vehicle is heavier due to overloading, brakes can also be overheated and lose effectiveness to stop the car. 
Apart from the risks involved in overloading and speeding a vehicle, the driver and the car owner would spend on higher maintenance costs to the vehicle, especially on the tyres, brakes, shock absorbers and higher fuel consumption. 
Dr Noel Tolgou Yempabe, Consultant Orthopaedic and head of the Trauma Unit at the Tamale Teaching Hospital (TTH) said road traffic injuries constituted a major health problem in the country. 
He lamented that the legal framework of car insurance for road traffic accident payment delays and affects medical treatment, which could also lead to disability, emotional trauma or loss of lives. 
According to him, the consequences of road traffic injuries are crucial for everyone on the roads and stakeholders should explore the potential ramifications of such incidents. 
He also attributed most of the trauma cases were the cost of delays at the traditional bonesetters’ centres, resulting in trauma related to deaths, amputations and disabilities, especially among children. 
Mr Bawa Salifu, who is a Person with disability and shared his experience during an interview with GNA said he had a road accident some few years ago which disabled him.  
He now depends on his family and friends who take care of him, as he can no longer walk. 
Apart from the personal consequences, road traffic accidents also have societal implications such as the economic cost of road traffic injuries is substantial, including medical expenses, loss of productivity, and property damage. 
The costs are borne by individuals, insurance companies, and the healthcare system and moreover, road traffic accidents can lead to congestion, delays, and increased insurance premiums for all road users. 
In the aftermath of a road traffic accident, legal implications arise, and seeking compensation becomes paramount. 
Victims have the right to pursue a personal injury claim to recover their losses and receive compensation for their pain and suffering. 
If successful, compensation can cover various aspects, such as medical expenses, loss of earnings, rehabilitation costs, and property damage, additionally, victims may be eligible for compensation for the impact of the injuries on their quality of life, including physical and psychological suffering. 
It is highly recommended to seek legal guidance from friendly claims specialists, with experience in road traffic accident claims to guide the victims through the legal process and assess the strength of your case. 
Dr Yempabe recommended that the government should deliver a plan for emergency care services in all the hospitals around the country by providing enough healthcare delivery equipment to improve quality health care delivery. 
He also called on other International Health Organisations to support Ghana’s health sector with medical equipment and to sponsor most of the road traffic accident victims who could not afford to pay for their medical treatment due to their financial challenges. 
Dr Dominic Konadu-Yeboah, the Head of Trauma and Orthopaedics at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in a discussion with GNA gave a short education on how to give first aid to the injured person as the eyewitness. 
 He said the first step is the limb with a fracture must be splinted and elevated to reduce swelling and occult bleeding into the site of the fracture. 
The second step is if there is severe visible bleeding from a fracture site apply direct pressure using a clean cloth and elevate the affected limb to control the bleeding 
The third step was to apply ice to a fracture site which also helps to reduce limb swelling and relieve pain and send the patients to the nearby hospital for early treatment to save lives. 
Dr.Yempabe advised the public to send patients with trauma cases to hospital services for proper treatment to reduce deaths and disability in society. 
Mr Bawa Gamsah, the Northern Regional Road Safety Director said there should be enforcement of wearing seat belts when driving and also wearing a helmet when riding the motorbike or tricycles which can also prevent more injuries and deaths. 
He also appealed to the government to support the road safety agencies with adequate resources such as funds, and more staff to improve the awareness creation and education on road safety as part of the fight against road traffic accidents in the country. 
He added that mostly in the Northern sector, most of the riders are under age riding without a license which also needed to be addressed by the stakeholders including parents and guardians.    
Mr Abdulai  Mutawakilo, the Northern Regional Manager for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA)  appealed to road users to follow the Road Vehicle Regulations 2022 which were amended on the offence to include any use of a hand-held mobile phone or other interactive communication device when using the road. 
He also encouraged all road users to regularly check their own eyesight to prevent drivers with visual disorders when driving. 
The government should build a strong partnership with road safety stakeholders such as the Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Road and Highways, National Road Safety Commission (NRSC), and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) to undertake probable solutions to fix the problem caused by human-related factor on road transport system by implementing a safety systems approach. 
Stakeholders in the road and transport sector should collaborate to establish an element which would apply to all road users, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists to ensure compliance with the law to avoid causing harm on the roads.  
The highway authorities and road operators must therefore implement an efficient checking system to enforce weights and dimensions at an affordable cost. 
The government should provide a large-scale project as part of the transport system to demonstrate the feasibility of using high-speed weight motion to direct enforcement of overloaded vehicles.  
With all these challenges it will be expedient for the Government to support teaching hospitals nationwide to organise training workshops for medical practitioners yearly, to enhance their capacities in providing quality health care for the populace. 
Non-governmental Organisations and philanthropic institutions must also assist trauma and orthopaedic departments across the country for proper rehabilitation and integration of patients into society.

He lamented that the legal framework of car insurance for road traffic accident payment delays and affects medical treatment, which could also lead to disability, emotional trauma or loss of lives. 
According to him, the consequences of road traffic injuries are crucial for everyone on the roads and stakeholders should explore the potential ramifications of such incidents. 
He also attributed most of the trauma cases were the cost of delays at the traditional bonesetters’ centres, resulting in trauma related to deaths, amputations and disabilities, especially among children. 
Mr Bawa Salifu, who is a Person with disability and shared his experience during an interview with GNA said he had a road accident some few years ago which disabled him.  
He now depends on his family and friends who take care of him, as he can no longer walk. 
Apart from the personal consequences, road traffic accidents also have societal implications such as the economic cost of road traffic injuries is substantial, including medical expenses, loss of productivity, and property damage. 
The costs are borne by individuals, insurance companies, and the healthcare system and moreover, road traffic accidents can lead to congestion, delays, and increased insurance premiums for all road users. 
In the aftermath of a road traffic accident, legal implications arise, and seeking compensation becomes paramount. 
Victims have the right to pursue a personal injury claim to recover their losses and receive compensation for their pain and suffering. 
If successful, compensation can cover various aspects, such as medical expenses, loss of earnings, rehabilitation costs, and property damage, additionally, victims may be eligible for compensation for the impact of the injuries on their quality of life, including physical and psychological suffering. 
It is highly recommended to seek legal guidance from friendly claims specialists, with experience in road traffic accident claims to guide the victims through the legal process and assess the strength of your case. 
Dr Yempabe recommended that the government should deliver a plan for emergency care services in all the hospitals around the country by providing enough healthcare delivery equipment to improve quality health care delivery. 
He also called on other International Health Organisations to support Ghana’s health sector with medical equipment and to sponsor most of the road traffic accident victims who could not afford to pay for their medical treatment due to their financial challenges. 
Dr Dominic Konadu-Yeboah, the Head of Trauma and Orthopaedics at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in a discussion with GNA gave a short education on how to give first aid to the injured person as the eyewitness. 
 He said the first step is the limb with a fracture must be splinted and elevated to reduce swelling and occult bleeding into the site of the fracture. 
The second step is if there is severe visible bleeding from a fracture site apply direct pressure using a clean cloth and elevate the affected limb to control the bleeding 
The third step was to apply ice to a fracture site which also helps to reduce limb swelling and relieve pain and send the patients to the nearby hospital for early treatment to save lives. 
Dr.Yempabe advised the public to send patients with trauma cases to hospital services for proper treatment to reduce deaths and disability in society. 
Mr Bawa Gamsah, the Northern Regional Road Safety Director said there should be enforcement of wearing seat belts when driving and also wearing a helmet when riding the motorbike or tricycles which can also prevent more injuries and deaths. 
He also appealed to the government to support the road safety agencies with adequate resources such as funds, and more staff to improve the awareness creation and education on road safety as part of the fight against road traffic accidents in the country. 
He added that mostly in the Northern sector, most of the riders are under age riding without a license which also needed to be addressed by the stakeholders including parents and guardians.    
Mr Abdulai  Mutawakilo, the Northern Regional Manager for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA)  appealed to road users to follow the Road Vehicle Regulations 2022 which were amended on the offence to include any use of a hand-held mobile phone or other interactive communication device when using the road. 
He also encouraged all road users to regularly check their own eyesight to prevent drivers with visual disorders when driving. 
The government should build a strong partnership with road safety stakeholders such as the Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Road and Highways, National Road Safety Commission (NRSC), and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority (DVLA) to undertake probable solutions to fix the problem caused by human-related factor on road transport system by implementing a safety systems approach. 
Stakeholders in the road and transport sector should collaborate to establish an element which would apply to all road users, including drivers, pedestrians, and cyclists to ensure compliance with the law to avoid causing harm on the roads.  
The highway authorities and road operators must therefore implement an efficient checking system to enforce weights and dimensions at an affordable cost. 
The government should provide a large-scale project as part of the transport system to demonstrate the feasibility of using high-speed weight motion to direct enforcement of overloaded vehicles.  
With all these challenges it will be expedient for the Government to support teaching hospitals nationwide to organise training workshops for medical practitioners yearly, to enhance their capacities in providing quality health care for the populace. 
Non-governmental Organisations and philanthropic institutions must also assist trauma and orthopaedic departments across the country for proper rehabilitation and integration of patients into society.

2024 is “Year of Completion”— Roads Minister | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Accra, Dec. 13, GNA – Mr Kwasi Amoako – Attah, Minister of Roads and Highways, has declared next year, 2024, as a “Year of Completion” to complete all commissioned and stalled roads projects in the country. 
He said the Ministry would ensure that all road projects, which started from 2017, especially projects in 2020 and 2021 under the “Year of Roads”, were completed by the end of 2024. 
Mr Amoako-Attah said this at an inspection of a soon-to-start two dual carriage road projects at Kasoa and Adentan. 
They comprised a 30 kilometre Kasoa to Winneba Roundabout dual carriage road and a 23-kilometre Adentan to Dodowa dual carriage road. 
The two projects will commence officially on January 01, 2024, after preparatory work and mobilisation are done. 
The Kasoa to Winneba dual carriage stretch would have double service lanes on each side, intersections and flyovers at Kasoa-Buduburam and Winneba Junction and would be completed in 36 months. 
The Adentan to Dodowa stretch would also be a dual carriage with double lanes on each side with service lanes and intersections and completed in 24 months. 
The Kasoa project is being undertaken by Nag Fairmount Company Limited, whereas the Adentan one is being done by Oswal Investments Limited; all local contractors. 
The Minister said the Kasoa and Adentan projects were part of four critical projects the Ministry would be undertaking in the year alongside the completion of existing ones. 
“These two road projects when completed will bring relief to the public, since it would ease traffic and make it safer to use the roads. They are two critical road networks that need to be dualised and opened to ease the stress on using them,” he added. 
Mr Amoako-Attah said the Ministry had in the last seven years built the capacity of more than 20 local contractors to enable them handle critical road projects. 
The Minister said the contractors had been instructed to work 24/7 to complete the projects on schedule.

Preparation for the dualisation of Kasoa-Winneba Road in the offing  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Preparation for the dualisation of Kasoa-Winneba Road in the offing 
Cape Coast, Dec. 08, GNA – The Ghana Highway Authority (GHA) has advanced the designing for the dualisation of the 34- 34-kilometre road from Kasoa to Winneba-junction, Mrs Mercy A. Payne, the Central Regional Director of the Authority has hinted. 
The designing would soon end for procurement processes to begin to select an efficient contractor for work to begin on the busy stretch to ease the chaotic vehicular traffic to improve travel time whilst addressing congestion issues. 
As part of the plan, major road intersections, particularly Akotsi junction noted for standstill traffic, would be redesigned to segregate the local traffic from the highway traffic. 
Though tight-lipped about the date for commencement of work, Mrs Payne assured of the Government’s commitment to have that stretch dualised, noting that: “Currently, the road capacity cannot accommodate the current traffic stress. 
“The intended construction is part of the broader Accra-Mankessim-Cape Coast dualisation being done in phases to boost tourism, attract and retain investments to the historic Region.” 
Mrs Payne was briefing members of the Central Regional Coordinating Council about the state of the Region’s roads during its meeting to take stock of development issues in the Region in accordance with the Local Government Act, (Act 932). 
In attendance were Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives, Presiding Members and heads of decentralized Ministries, Departments, and Agencies, traditional and religious authorities, security agencies and the media. 
Mrs Payne also proposed a proper market to build at the 400-acre land onion market at Gomoa Fetteh which she described as “a fast-looming slum.” 
According to her, the scheme for the onion market as part of the dualisation of the road would ensure dedicated lanes for commuters to help avoid accidents. 
“The current situation where people just enter the market anyhow and leave, whilst drivers stop at any point to pick passengers for others to enter or leave is not the best. 
 …so, the whole place is becoming chaotic as the plantain and fish sellers have all joined in,” she explained. 
Touching on other ongoing road projects, she mentioned the Winneba-junction –Agona Swedru Road, Swedru-Afransi-Ajumako Road, Potsin junction-Potsin Road, 
Others are the partial reconstruction of sections of Cape Coast-Twifo Praso and sectional repair works on the 08 – (Yamoransa-Assin Fosu highway) to reduce the rampant road accidents between Winneba junction-Mankessim. 
For the situation of the road mix, Mrs Payne explained that the Region has a total of 1,180.7 kilometres of highway roads covering a land size of 9,826 km² for the estimated 2,859,821 population. 
Of the total road network, 852.5 km are paved representing 72.2 per cent, whilst 328.2 km are unpaved resenting 27.8 per cent. 
About 295.8 km are good representing 24.0 per cent, 694.6 km are fair representing 58.0 per cent and 210.3 km representing 18.0 per cent is in a poor state. 
Mrs Payne also underscored major challenges including the suspension of road works due to delays in payment of contractors, and encroachment on the right of way which disrupts road expansion due to huge payments of compensation. 
Others are; excessive axle loading, vandalism of road furniture, illegal speed humps, road accidents, illegal access to trunk roads, traffic congestion and bottlenecks due to commercial activities, particularly at Akotsi-junction and Buduburam.  
For urban roads, Mr Jacob Nelson, Regional Director of Urban Roads said his outfit operated in eight Assemblies including Cape Coast, Agona West, Assin Fosu, Upper Denkyira East, Komenda-Edina-Eguafo-Abrem (KEEA), Awutu Senya East, Efutu and Mfantseman. 
He said the Region had a total of 1389.98 urban roads comprising 945.97km of unpaved roads representing 68 per cent and 444.01km of paved roads representing 32 per cent. 
Though he was elated about some major upcoming projects in Abrem-Kafodzidzi road in KEEA, and Eguasi-Amosima-Nkanfoa town roads, he was concerned about myriad of challenges stifling their work. 
Key among them are the pilfering of traffic light cables at Pedu junction, encroachments on road reservations, damage to the road caused by pipe leakages and repairs by the Ghana Water Company Limited. 
Mrs Justina Marigold Assan, the Central Regional Minister in a speech read on her behalf, commended the Assemblies and other stakeholders for their hard work in various regional programmes such as the Farmers Day and HIV/AIDS celebrations, Central Expo, and sanitation interventions. 
Ahead of the District Assembly elections, she underlined the need for all candidates and followers to conduct clean campaigns devoid of rancour and acrimony to maintain the peace in the Region.

Volta Region received unprecedented road infrastructure under NPP — Akufo-Addo   | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Volta Region received unprecedented road infrastructure under NPP — Akufo-Addo  
Ho, Nov. 6, GNA – President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, says the Volta region had seen unprecedented road infrastructure under the New Patriotic Party (NPP) government.   
He said the government had constructed 432 kilometres of road since assuming office in January 2017.  
President Akufo-Addo said these when addressing chiefs and people of the Anlo State at a durbar in Anloga to mark the 2023 Hogbetsotso festival, under the theme: “Climate Change, a Challenge to Lands below Sea Level, a Concern of the Anlo State and the Stakeholders.”  
He said the roads include the completion of the dualisation of the 22km Ho main road.   
He said others were the 30km Have to Kpando road, the upgrading of the Golokwati -Wli road, resealing of the 15km Asikuma junction to Ho Road, regravelling of the 30km Frankadua to Adidome road and the surfacing of the 17.8km Matse-Klave and Lume Atsiame-Avetokoe roads.  
President Akufo-Addo said other roads were asphaltic overlay on 15km of town roads in Hohoe; bitumen surfacing of the 15.6km Akwetey-Adaklu-Waya feeder road and bitumen surfacing of Bume-Danyigba-Anfoega road.   
He mentioned the Danyigba Town Roads, Dra-Sabadu road, and Bume-Agata road; bitumen surfacing of the 12km Yorkitikpo-Kpoviadzi-Trepe road.  
President Akufo-Addo said the rest were the bitumen surfacing of the 9.7km Mafi-Adadepo, Wute/Yorkitikpo and Kpoviadzi feeder roads; bitumen surfacing of the 9.7km Liati Agbonyira-Fodome-Ahor road; and the upgrading of 2.5 km Klefe town roads.  
He said work was also steadily ongoing on the 5.3km Ho By-Pass dualisation project which was 37 per cent complete, as is work on the upgrading of 8km of selected roads in Ketu South, which is 48 per cent complete.  
President Akufo-Addo said construction work on the Eastern Corridor Roads had progressed in sharp contrast to what had been done at the end of 2016, which saw only 135km of the roads, representing 27 per cent in good condition.  
“As at the end of 2022, 366 km, that is 74 per cent of the Corridor had improved from poor to good state. This has had a positive impact on the movement of goods and people along the corridor.”  
He said government had cancelled the contracts awarded to contractors working on the Aflao to Denu to Dzodze to Ave Afiadenyigba to Ave Dakpa to Ho Road.  
President Akufo-Addo said contracts of contractors on the Denu to Havedzi to Keta Road, Srogbe to Anyanui road, Agortoe Junction to Tregbui to Adutor road, Anyako to Seva road and the Weta to Metsrikasa road had also been terminated since most of the contractors failed to carry out the works.  
He said the Ministry of Roads and Highways had decided to terminate the current contracts and re-package them for the award.  
President Akufo-Addo said in the short term, the mobile maintenance unit of the Ghana Highway Authority would be deployed to undertake emergency maintenance of the very critical sections of the roads.  
He said the government had also secured funding of 89 United States million dollars from the African Development Bank towards the construction of the 29.35 km Asutsuare Junction to Volivo road.   
President Akufo-Addo said other roads to benefit included the 39.2 km Dorfor Adidome to Asikuma Junction Road, the 23.9km Asutsuare Junction to Aveyime road, and two interchanges at Dorfor Adidome and Asikuma Junction.  
He said procurement processes were underway to start the roads by the first quarter of 2024.

Fix Kasoa Highway — Ga South Municipality Residents Appeal  | Ghana News Agency
Ghana's preferred news source: Accurate, Credible, Objective, Timely
Kasoa (C/R), Oct. 24, GNA – Hundreds of protestors in the Ga South Municipality have marched on the Mallam-Kasoa highway to protest the traffic situation commuters endure on daily basis which is compounded when it rains. 
Organized by Accra FM of the Class Media Group, the event had a hash tag “Fix Kasoa Highway.”  
The demonstrators converged at the Tuba taxi rank and marched on the highway to Barrier where it submitted a petition to authorities of the Assembly.  
They blocked both sides of the road from Accra to Kasoa and vice versa leading to a heavy traffic for more than two hours as they displayed placards with inscriptions “Drop The Cathedral And Fix Kasoa Highway,” “We Are No More Spectators, Fix Kasoa Roads,” “The IMF Money Can Fix Kasoa Highway,” “Families dey chop Ghanaians dey die, save our lives” and “King Promise do something before you go”.  
Mainly made up of the youth, drivers, and residents the demonstrators vented out their frustrations as passengers complained over delays in traffic, drivers lamented over burning of fuel and frequent maintenance of their vehicles due to the bad nature of the roads. 
At Tuba, heaps of mudslide of erosion from a hill which had settled on the road, right after the tollbooth towards broadcasting all in the Ga South municipality resulted in a heavy traffic. 
Portions of the road had developed huge potholes because of the mudslide, caused by sand winning activities in the area. 
At Bortianor, Ayigbe Town to Barrier and its surrounding communities the roads were flooded making it unmotorable and this had claimed lives over the years.  
The protestors stopped at vital spots including the office of the Member of Parliament (MP) for the Constituency, Mr Sylvester Mensah Tetteh and demanded to see him but met his absence. 
A swift intervention of the police prevented the demonstrators from vandalising his office.   
Minutes after, there was a clash between the demonstrators and an anti-landguard squad of the Ghana Police Service, which the demonstrators claimed were called in by the MP for the area. 
They said, Road Minister, Mr Kwasi Amoako-Atta, had visited the area together with engineers from the Municipal Assembly, Roads and Highway Department and the Ministry but had since not been attended to. 
They had demanded the presence of the Road Minister or the MCE to submit their petition but the municipal engineer, Ing Daniel Nii Sowah received it from Ms Elaine Attoh, convenor who gave government two-week ultimatum to begin works or they would hit the streets again. 
He received the petition on behalf of the Municipal Chief Executive, Mr Joseph Nyarni and assured them that the petition would be delivered for onward submission to the President.  
Mr Akwasi Addo, a lead person who doubles as the central regional correspondent of Metro TV said many commuters spent productive hours in traffic each day especially when it rained. 
He said that he had personally lost a job opportunity in Accra due to the daily heavy traffic on that stretch.  
He called on government to as a matter of urgency fix the problem to mitigate the challenges on the stretch.
