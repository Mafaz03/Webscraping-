UPNG journalism studentThousands of people living in the Gerehu suburb in Port Moresby will for the next 12 months experience difficulties in commuting following the start of a year long road construction.After the completion of the first construction of the main area road from Gerehu stage one to stage six, another year construction work is underway in the corridors of Gerehu, along the bus stop next to the Bismillah shops.
According to Phoenix Construction who has undertaken the project, the half a mile road structure starting from the Gerehu main bus stop roundabout to the Kasia Cycle roundabout is anticipated to cause traffic congestion that will definitely impact daily commuters.Phoenix site engineer, Philimon Mondolame said the new road construction progress will depend on the funding from the National Capital District Commission.“The reason for working at one section of the road at a time is because the funding is not paid in full but in installments so the funds are released when a block of the road is completed,” he said.
Another factor that significantly affect construction is weather as periods of heavy rain hinder any progress.Mr Mondale noted that traffic is currently being controlled by blocking the road in front of Gerehu Mart in order to work on the left side of the bus stop.Once the bus stop is completed then the blockade will be shifted and normalcy should return.

Construction will soon begin on the Indagen-Lae Road project in Kabwum, Morobe Province.
Morobe Governor Luther Wenge did the ground-breaking ceremony in Indagen village last Friday witnessed by people from the Komba, Selepet and Deyamos local level governments.
Governor Wenge said the people of Kabwum really need a road link to Lae and this road will be a priority.
He said funding of K2 million from Morobe provincial services improvement program has been allocated to upgrade the road from Tipsit to Indagen.
“Once this is done, I will allocate another K10 million for road construction to begin from Indagen in Kabwum to Burum-Kuat in Finschhafen and finally into Samanzing in Nawaeb to Lae,” he said.
“Work on this road should start in the next three weeks once machineries are shipped to Wasu from Lae.
“It will start here in Indagen and then going towards Lae and not from Lae to Indagen.”
Governor Wenge said Finschhafen MP Rainbo Paita and Prime Minister James Marape have pledged commitments to support the road project.
However, he did not reveal the commitments pledge but stated that he will closely follow-up with them on this funding commitments to deliver this economic road for the people of Kabwum.

A THIRTY-six kilometre Ring Road Project in the Rigo North LLG of Rigo District in Central Province has been completed by Koia Investment Company Limited.
The Ring Road will now serve 20 council wards of North Rigo LLG who have been suffering from lack of better road access for the last 27 years. The Ring Road project was funded by the Central Provincial Government under the works program.
Present during the completion of the road last Sunday (27th August) were ), respective community leaders of Rigo North owner of the construction company Biari Ubuna, Acting Police Station Commander of Kwikila police station, Sergeant Bobby Ogara and a representative from the Rigo district development authority.
A community Leader Murray Gini thanked the constructor and the Central provincial government for providing the needed service to the 17, 000 plus population of Rigo North.
“The 20 council wards in the hinterland of Rigo District gratefully accolade praise to the management of KICL for the construction of Sivitatana – Wiga road connection,” Gini said.
“The road has been cut off for public use for about 27 years ago, which in other words can be put as political negligence for the last 5 terms by the previous governments.
“The Prime Minister James Marape declared the Rigo Inland Ring Road as Yagabo Highway when he was invited at Boregaina Village in late 2020 and he had announced K27 million for the road project.
In proceed to that announcement, this portion of the road was not accounted for and this has led our people to uncertainty of the effectiveness of government commitments.
“The people of Rigo North wish to give special thanks and accord to KICL, our sincere appreciation for the great achievement in bringing the road home to us.”
Biari thanked the leaders and people of Rigo North for working together with the constructor and successfully completed the project.
“The constructor is not here to make money but to deliver the needed service to the people of Rigo North.
Even though the scope of the road project ends at Dilikomana village, yet we have continued further for about 8 kilometres to Matanatou Sub Health Centre to fully connect the Ring Road. 
Biari further acknowledged and thanked the Central provincial government for making the funding available to complete the Ring Road project.

The noise of machines bulldozing and cutting into the thick virgin forest to build the first road into the landlocked and remote Bosavi local level government in the Nipa-Kutubu district is in indeed a 48th Independent Anniversary gift for these people in that part of the country.
Walking and hauling cargo on their backs like camels for days through thick forest and tough rugged terrains from Hidinia village in the Lower Foi in the Kutubu LLG to Mt Bosavi has been the normal practise for the people, when they did not have the money to pay for the expensive airfares from Mt Hagen.
The local MP Dr Billy Joseph has become the saviour of this forgotten people, when he and his district development authority decided to give these forgotten people an early 48 years Independence Anniversary gift.
Reality came to he fore when the first machine started working on the road to give access to the more than 20 000 people.
Thanks to Dr Joseph, the Bosavi road construction started on Monday this week when the first machine started to cut into the thick jungles to open up access.
More than 20 000 people live in this part of the area and despite being isolated, they made headlines recently on the kidnapping incidents.
Dr Joseph said the Nipa-Kutubu District Development Authority (NKDDA) with assitance from the Mt Bosavi LLG and the Kutubu LLG have injected the initial finding of K7million to start the construction of the road with no assistance from the Provincial and National Governments.
“Today is a historic and milestone occasion when the first machine started punching road into the landlocked communities.
“Our people live in poverty and have endured the hardships in life for almost 48 years since Independence with an absence of a road connectivity,” he said.

District authorites called upon to maintain roads - Post Courier

By MICHAEL KOMATHE responsibility is on the district development authorities to maintain roads in their respective districts.Chuave man Simon Gunua said this after seeing many potholes on the 13 kilometre Chuave-Movi road in the limestone-riddled district.
He said the road was sealed in 2007 by a road construction company with funding made available under the PIP “but successive DDAs and the Simbu Provincial Government had failed to maintain the stretch.He said the National Government has saved Chuave’s district service improvement program (DSIP) allocation by financing that particular road infrastructure project “so the DDA should patch the potholes and rehabilitate deteriorated
portions”.Gumine man Urmil Sine has echoed similar sentiments saying the Kundiawa-Gumine road also needs maintenance, and gave examples of deteriorating portions and potholes on the 43 kilometre stretch.
The road was sealed with funding allocated by the same source in 1998 when Aulkupa Patrick was the local MP.Mr Sine said: “Hardly any maintenance was carried out on the district’s major trunk road since bitumen was applied 22 years
ago.”Four men in Eastern Highlands remote Okapa and Lufa areas have also called on their DDAs to allocate funds for the Korefeigu-Lufa and the Korefeigu-Okapa station roads that serve an estimated 110,000 people.
Tribal and youth leaders in Gembogl, Kerowagi (Chimbu), Nondugl and Banz (Jiwaka), Mul-Baiyer and Tambul-Nebilyer (Western Highlands) and Porgera (Enga) have also expressed similar concerns.They called upon their respective DDAs to maintain sealed (trunk) roads in the districts to enable smooth flow of traffic from the rural areas to urban centres.

BY JOAN BAILEYA further K100 million has been committed by the Marape–Rosso Government to upgrade existing roads in Lae, the industrial capital of Morobe, in the coming years.Deputy Prime Minister and Lae MP John Rosso revealed this during the official launching of the Chinatown (Bumbu) Malahang road on Monday.
He said industrial roads and priority interior roads within the city will be considered under this funding because standard and good road condition are needed to complement the major developments in the city.Mr Rosso said this funding is expected to be made available by next year for more road construction, adding that as the Lae MP, his role is to secure funding and ensure it is available to the Department of Works and contractors to upgrade roads.“Funding is not easy to secure as all MPs, governors and development sectors are competing for a share of the funding from the National Government.
But I will try my best to maintain close consultation with Works and Highways Minister Solan Mirisim and secretary David Wereh, so hopefully we get some funding.“I am happy that our main road from Unitech to Tent City has been concreted followed by the Chinatown to Malahang Industrial Centre section of the Independence Drive,” he said.Mr Rosso said upgrading is now taking place on Mongola Street to a concreted high standard road.
He said plans are in place to secure funding for upgrading of Tent City to Busu Bridge and Second Seven dump to Bumayong roads to concrete roads in his second term in parliament.“Butibam to Kamkumung road will also be upgraded to concrete, while Kamkumung Bridge will be replaced with a new bridge to cater for four lanes.“Yalu Bridge has been contracted out already and work will begin soon to replace it with a new four lane bridge to complement the four lane Lae-Nadzab Highway.”Mr Rosso said in the last three years, the Pangu-led government has spent K3 billion on road constructions and they are committed to making roads accessible to the bulk of the population in the country.He also mentioned that the K400 million Yalu-Nadzab four-lane road project has been contracted out and work is progressing.

China and Algeria have joined forces in a significant partnership to construct an expansive 6,000 kilometers of railway lines within the North African nation, a move lauded by Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune as pivotal in advancing his country's socio-economic progress.
Earlier this month, Tebboune said in a regular interview with representatives of the national media that strengthening the railway sector is the "best guarantee of development", stressing that "our Chinese friends have agreed to this project, which will cover a distance of around 6,000 km." The aim is to facilitate the exploitation of mines, promote trade and create economic vitality in Algeria.
The ambitious railway project is part of the two countries' broader cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the massive China-proposed project to boost global trade and commerce by improving infrastructure and connectivity.
A member of the Algerian parliament said the project, which is to be supported by Chinese technical know-how and construction expertise, will connect all cities and regions in Algeria, and also pave the way for economic development in several African countries.
"China views Algeria as a gateway to Africa. It's a win-win partnership for both sides. This is the spirit of the Belt and Road Initiative and Algeria's development plan. Algeria views China as a trusted partner," said Said Hamsi, an Algerian MP, in an interview with China Global Television Network (CGTN) on Saturday.
Algerian economist Karim Allam also said he believes that the mega railway project will provide significant opportunities for economic growth and job creation in the country.
"The Algerian President expressed his intention to entrust this mega project to the Chinese partners who have the experience and the expertise in this field. China is the second largest economic power in the world. Developing 6,000 kilometers of railway will allow Algeria to achieve a phenomenal economic growth," he said.
Algerians have welcomed the announcement made by President Tebboune.
"As an Algerian student, I'm very optimistic about this project that will create endless opportunities," said Riyadh, an Algerian student.
"This railway project between Algeria and the People's Republic of China will be very important for all Algerian citizens. It will make life easier for everyone," echoed Abdel Kader, another Algerian citizen.
President Tebboune's announcement came after his state visit to China last month. During his trip, the two countries signed more than a dozen cooperation agreements in various sectors including aerospace, agriculture, energy, railway transportation, science and technology.

BY PEARSON KOLOTHE last village of the Lower Lai constituency in the Wapenamanda Open Electorate in the Enga Province has finally been unlocked and connected to the outside world by road.This is after excavators from the Wapenamanda District Development Authority finally reached Tupokores, a village bordering Kompiam district and Baiyer Lumusa in the Western Highlands Province.
This road will continue into Lumusa and Baiyer and to Mt Hagen in due time.People living in these areas have shouldered coffee bags, garden produce and store goodsfor the past decades but these these struggles will be memories of the past as the road opens them up.This road construction is undertaken by Wapenamanda MP Miki Kaeok who is also the Vice Minister for Works and Highways.
Approximately 80 kilometres of roadworks have already been covered from Mambisanda near Wapenamanda to the last Tupokores village and will continue joining nearby Kompaim and eventually into Baiyer.This road is part of the National government’s Connect PNG road program and is expected to link Wapenamanda to Baiyer and to Madang through the Baiyer Madang Highway.

A historical and significant achievement under this medium term development progress of the govenrment is the delivery of the much-anticipated connectivity between the southern and northern parts of the country.Thanks to the government’s key infrastructure flagship program, Connect PNG, the 94km road construction that started in 2016 that connects Gulf, Southern Highlands and Hela, is now open for use.People who live in those rural enclaves can now seek markets with their rural produce through this connected-missing link.
The Aigiru Highway starts in Kikori, links the Okuk Highway and stops in either Lae or Madang.Prime Minister James Marape, who spent his Christmas and New Year on these highway, is grateful and pleased at this milestone achievement.“I thank the Works and Highways Department for connecting the South and the North through the opening up of the Erave Simberingi Road,” Mr Marape said.
“Over 60 per cent of this road link, which is called route 700, is sealed and though 40 per cent is not sealed, it is usable.“The government is committed to funding this road, and we hope to seal the remaining 40 per cent in this medium term,” Minister for Works and Highways Solan Mirisim added.He said the government remains committed to connect the missing links in the country, opening up all landlocked areas in the rural areas, and allow greater accessibility for people to enjoy benefits of government services and businesses.
“The govenrment has allocated a complete funding of K1.6 billion to the Department of Works and Highways, and we will ensure government priority roads are constructed to highest standard,” Mr Mirisim said.The Connect PNG 2020-2040 is a 20-years transport infrastructure development strategy intended to maintain, rehabilitate and construct strategic socio-economic development roads that will support farmers, tourism, schools, and health care centres and expand the benefits nationwide.The other national targeted roads includes, Baiyer to Madang, Telefomin to Tambul, East-West New Britain, and off course, the Trans Islands Highway, connecting Port Moresby to Highlands and Momase regions.

K88 million Halimbu to Koroba road works launched - Post Courier

Prime Minister James Marape says least-developed districts like Koroba-Kopiago in Hela province are for the first time seeing development.He said this in Koroba last Friday when launching the sealing of the last section of the Highlands Highway from Halimbu Junction to Koroba at a cost of K88.89 million.A 10 per cent upfront payment of K8.889 million was made to the contractor on Friday to start work as well as K8 million for the contractor of another road from Maria to Kopiago.
This comes under the Marape government’s flagship “Connect PNG Program” with 30 per cent counterpart funding from Hela provincial government – despite it being a national project.“Koroba-Kopiagio is one of the least developed districts in PNG like Telefomin, Tari-Pori, Karimui, Goilala, Pomio, Kandrian-Gloucester, Nuku, Middle Ramu, Jimi, Samarai-Murua and Esa’ala,” Mr Marape told thousands of people at Koroba.“Over the last two years, we have given over K2 billion worth of contracts for infrastructure development throughout the country, with those in Hela including the roads from Komo to Halimbu, Ambua to Tari, and from Ambua to Mendi.
“Along the Highlands Highway, major roadworks have been completed, including two-lane bridges all the way from Lae to Mt Hagen.“The Works Minister and Works Secretary recently launched construction of the road from Vanimo to Aitape, and from Aitape to Wewak.“These are just a few of the many road projects being developed with this K2 billion.
“Over the next three years, we will be issuing another K5 billion worth of road projects throughout PNG, and Koroba is also included in this program.“The road from Halimbu Junction to Koroba is being built at a cost of K88 million, Maria to Kopiago K90 million, as well as various others.“I want this last section of the Highlands Highway from Halimbu to Koroba to be completed over the next five years so that you are no longer a ‘forgotten place’.“I am here to show you today that you are not forgotten by the Government of PNG.”Mr Marape thanked the Hela Provincial Government and Governor Philip Undialu for the 30 per cent counterpart funding.“This type of counterpart funding has never been done before for a national highway,” he said.“The road from Halimbu to Koroba is a national highway, however, I thank the Hela Provincial Government for bearing 30 per cent of the costs when it did not have to.”Mr Marape said this money will be reimbursed through the National Government funding a provincial road in Hela.He said what Hela had done was a good example for other provincial governments in the country to follow.

EAST New Britain is in for further economic development in the province.
This follows plans afoot for a major ground breaking ceremony later this week for the construction of a four-lane highway from Tokua to Kokopo City.
The ground breaking ceremony for the two phase multi- million-kina project will mark the first which is the construction of a 17km stretch of road from Tokua to Kokopo.
According to a statement released by the East New Britain Governor Michael Marum, Prime Minister James Marape and Minister for Works and Highway Solan Misirin will officiate at the event.

He said Mr Marape will be there on the Governor’s invitation to see other project areas also in the province.
The Prime Minister will visit the Rabaul town electrification projects and the solar farm.
The Tokua to Kokopo City road project is one of three major road developments which Mr Marape is committed.

A famous track used by the colonial administrators to travel between Koroba and Lake Kopiago in the Hela Province has been rehabilitated, thanks to the local MP Mr William Bando who spent no time to open up that missing link.
The Koroba-Kopiago district development authority, under the leadership of their local MP Mr William Bando, wasted no time to construct the Teria-Yagabi to Kakoma road, a colonial track that was used as a short cut to travel between Koroba and Kopaigo.
The Teria-Yaguabi to Kakoma road is among 8 other rundown roads that are undergoing major rehabilitation and maintenance, a major development initiative undertaken by the local MP within the first one year in office. 
Since being elected into office, Mr Bando prioritised law and order and road network in his district. 
He said opening up road accessibility and opening up missing links and rundown road network in the province can change mindsets and the perception of people and there he wasted no time to rehabilitate all the major road network in the district that have been neglected by past leaderships.
According to the locals, the Teria-Yaguabi –Kakoma road project took just less than 4 months and covered almost 7 kilometres, and it is about to reach the main Highlands Highway which will be connecting the frontiers of Tumbutu valley in the North of Koroba to Kopiago Basin excessing 32 council wards of more than 50, 000 population which used to be known as ‘back-page’ due to lack of services delivery.
“Opening up missing link road and rehabilitation of the old colonial roads that have deteriorated overtime is indeed a welcome initiative of the MP.
“We appreciate the MPs tireless construction team on the ground for the tremendous work done in a speedy limit, providing some of the best road construction we have never seen before. 
We also acknowledge the Mr Bando for his leadership, irrespective of the political difference, he is equally distributing services to everyone and that is the kind of leadership we want to see, a matured, smart and innovative leadership,” a local said on the Koroba-Kopaigo social media forum.

The Wabag District Development Authority is embarking on linking Wabag and Laiagam districts in Enga province by road.The road works resumed last week starting at Sopas and will pass through Yokonda before reaching Kanak in Lagaip district.Wabag MP and Health Minister Dr Lino Tom said that the road will be an alternate link to Laiagam through the fertile plateau of Yokonda in Sirunki area.
Dr ToM said he was confident that before the end of this year, road construction is expected to reach Laiagam.“A very important commodity road that will see fresh high altitude vegetables reach our new market,” he said.He said the two major pillar policies of the Wabag district is empowering the people through agriculture-based small and medium enterprise (SME) activities and universal quality education. He said both policies will be achieved through this important road link as the bulk of the rural population lives in this part of the electorate.
Dr Tom acknowledged the local Sakarowan clan of the Malipin tribe for taking ownership of this vital project and allowing work to continue.

BY NELSON JOETHE election is not having any impact on the improvement programs currently under way in Goroka, Eastern Highlands Province.Construction work is continuing on those roads that were started recently.
On the first four-lane road along the Elizabeth Street from the junction of the Highlands Highway to the Goroka Bowling Club, the contractor China Wi is filling up and compacting the road base while the drain work is still continuing.This will be followed by application of bitumen and then spreading of fine gravel.Operator Jimmy Bire of Nokondi Works, from whom the contractor has hired some earth moving machinery to work on the project, said there is no funding issue and the contractor is determined to complete the work within the three-month schedule.
He said bad weather has hindered their progress from time to time.At Dog Street, along the Bihute road bypassing the Goroka Provincial Hospital, the top soil is cleared and the contractor Columbus is working on the drains and culverts.One of the employees working there said they will dig some more and then fill up with road base and compact it.
At the time the work on the roads began, the PNG Fire Service Goroka branch stepped in and marked out the positions of the fire hydrants which the contractor should consider when working on thew road.
Eastern Highlands Works unit is supervising both projects.Meanwhile, work on stonewalling and flower beds at the Rotary Park in West Goroka is continuing as well.This is part of the beautification program that the Goroka District Development Authority, has embarked on to engage youths in suburbs around town.Foothpaths at the back of the Yanepa Building and the Peace Park under this program are completed.

BY PAUL BUNGTABUWORK on the Malona to Mapuna Road right through to the new hydropower project at Toto River in the new Mamusi Yana local level government in East New Britain Province is nearing completion.Pomio MP Elias Kapavore and members of district development authority were recently at the construction site to inspect the road project.
The new road will also link Mapuna, Peling and Kaitoto to the Palmalmal township.The project is funded by the district development authority.Mr Kapavore said the road will connect the Palmalmal headquarters to the new Mamusi Yana LLG chamber, which will also be constructed in Mapuna once the road is fully graded.
He said road connectivity still remains a big challenge in most of the rural communities in East New Britain and this includes most inland villages in Pomio.“I thank AG Energy Ltd for a great job in tearing the mountains down and connecting our people,” Mr Kapavore said.He said AG Energy Ltd was engaged to construct the proposed hydropower project.
‘’The Malona Road will lead directly to the proposed hydropower station at River Toto,’’ he said.Mr Kapavore said some of the best coffee is also cultivated in the mountains of Mamusi and the road is a relief to many farmers.“The road will boost the economy in these rural parts of the district,” he said.The Malona Road will be commissioned later this month.The people of Mapuna, Kaitoto and Peling will now have access to a new road.

BY FRANCO NEBAS and JONATHAN JOEConstruction work on the Erap – Dinangat road is midway through to reaching the first village of Kabwum district with the completion of nine kilometre.Yus local level government council civil work manager Erap Menanga said during a visit by media personals to the project site last Thursday.
He said a total of K1.8 million was allocated by the Kabwum District Development Authority (DDA) for the maintenance of Erap – Rabisap section of the road (Nawaeb) and the new cut Rabisap-Dinangat road.He said the local MP Patrick Basa’s aim was to see that the four LLGs in the district get connected with the district and provincial headquarters by road.He said the civil work team has been established in respective LLGs of Yus, Deyamos, Selepet and Komba with allocation of funds to build and upgrade roads in their respective LLGs.
“Kabwum is one of the districts with rough terrains, rivers and many mountains making it difficult for people to have access to government services.The only mode of transportation is by air but it is costly for ordinary villagers to afford to uplift their cash crops and fresh food vegetables to Lae.“It also affect little SME operators especially trade stores owners to uplift their store good supplies into to their respective LLGs,” he said.
“When Mr Basa was elected into office, one of his visions was to have the LLGs connected by road to the district and provincial headquarter to ease the burdens for his people,” said Mr Menanga.He said the current road project will not only serve the people of Kabwum but also Nawaeb district especially in Wain-Erap LLG.He said the Erap–Rabisap road had been neglected over the years without maintenance by Nawaeb DDA.“We had to pass through villages in Nawaeb district into Kabwum, therefore we had to maintain the deteriorating section of their road between Erap and Rabisap that was left neglected over the years.”He said the road serves a total population of nine thousands from the two districts, Nawaeb and Kabwum.“This road is one of the economic corridors to the people of Nawaeb and Kabwum in terms of agriculture,” he said.He said the project has reached over 9km at the cost of K1.8m.“It will take a month to reach the boarder but we need funding. We want counterpart funding from the Provincial Government, Governor Ginson Saonu and Nawaeb DDA under local MP Kennedy Wenge.“Only with one excavator we have been able to reach more than 9km from Rabisap to where we are right now.“We have 20km more to go to Dinanga and we need funding to help us build bridges.Yus LLG President Kitowe Mumusio commended MP Basa for the initiative taken to connect Kabwem by road.He said road is one of the main challenges that people of Kabwum face for many years.“We have cash crops, fresh food vegetables but it is costly by air and I believe the construction of this new road will contribute to the economy of Nawaeb and Kabwum districts.“I want this road to be Kabwum Highway so people will be happy.“On behalf of the people I thanked MP Basa for his vision to connect Kabwum by road,” he said.
