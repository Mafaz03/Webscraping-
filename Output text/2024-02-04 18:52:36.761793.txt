Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram are going to polls from November 7 to November 30. The results of these assemblies on December 3 will set the tone for the general election in 2024.The heartland states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh are set to witness a direct clash between BJP and Congress. In 2018, the Congress had wrested all three states from BJP. But since then, it has lost power in Madhya Pradesh following a rebellion by Jyotiraditya Scindia. Meanwhile, Telangana elections will be the first real test for the newly revamped TRS (now BRS) led by chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao, who has been harbouring national ambitions. After losing Karnataka, BJP is looking to gain some foothold in the southern state and may emerge as a formidable challenge for BRS. Meanwhile, the BJP is also looking to maintain its presence in Mizoram to retain dominance over the entire northeastern region.2023 has already witnessed some high-octane electoral battles with mainstream parties as well as regional behemoths clashing with each other to retain key states ahead of national polls. The year began with elections in the northeastern states of Nagaland, Tripura and Meghalaya, with all of them giving a thumbs up to the BJP and its allies. In Tripura, the BJP and IPFT retained power, albeit with a reduced seat share. In Nagaland too, BJP and senior ally NDPP cruised to an easy victory. In Meghalaya, which saw a hung verdict, the Conrad Sangma-led NPP formed the government with the help of a post-alliance with BJP and others.During the summer, the country witnessed a heated contest between the BJP and Congress in Karnataka, where the grand old party prevailed over the ruling BJP. The victory in Karnataka gave Congress the much-needed fillip ahead of its direct contests with BJP in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.Now, with the final elections of 2023 in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Telangana and Mizoram, we will gain a better understanding of which party or group holds the upper hand leading up to the Lok Sabha polls.Election Result 2023 | Madhya Pradesh Election Result 2023 | Rajasthan Election Result 2023 | Telangana Election Result 2023 | Chhattisgarh Election Result 2023About usCreate Your Own AdTerms of Use and Grievance Redressal Policy Privacy policyAdvertise with usRSSNewsletterFeedbackePaperSitemapArchivesFOLLOW US ONOther Times Group News SitesThe Economic TimesHindi Economic TimesNavbharat TimesMaharashtra TimesVijaya KarnatakaTelugu SamayamTamil SamayamMalayalam SamayamEi SamayI am GujaratTimes NowTimes Now NavbharatTimesPointsIndiatimesBrand CapitalEducation TimesTimes FoodMiss KyraPopular CategoriesHeadlinesSports NewsBusiness NewsIndia NewsWorld NewsBollywood NewsHealth & Fitness TipsIndian TV ShowsCelebrity PhotosHot on the WebTwinkle KhannaRanbir KapoorBest FoodIPS Manoj KumarRubina DilaikAnand MahindraSuresh Gopi Daughter WeddingMerry Christmas CollectionIra KhanAbhishek KumarTop TrendsAyodhya Ram MandirPakistan Iran War News LiveJEE Mains 2024UGC NET Result 2023IND vs AFG HighlightsChandigarh Mayor ElectionDelhi Weather TodayHoroscope TodayPran Pratishtha CelemonyStock Market TodayIran Strikes on PakistanIndia Maldives NewsFlight Cancellations TodayIsrael Hamas WarCovid Cases in IndiaPM Modi Kerala VisitBudget 2024 IndiaIPL 2024Trending TopicsSuresh Gopi Daughter WeddingSania MirzaHanu Man CollectionAmazon SaleTop 10 Brands in Modular KitchenVastu TipsNatural ScrubAyalaan CollectionJanhvi KapoorPalak TiwariGuntur Kaaram CollectionCoffee AlternativesCaptain Miller CollectionShraddha KapoorIndia Hanuman TemplesParenting TipsLaptops DiscountKitchen ChimneyBudget Smartwatches Under 5000Amazing Fashion DealsLiving and entertainmentViral NewsViral VideosFeminaETimesGraziaZoomTravel DestinationsBombay TimesCricbuzz.comFilmfareTVLifestyleLongwalks AppNewspaper SubscriptionFood NewsTimes PrimeWhats HotServicesCouponDuniaMagicbricksTechGigTimesJobsBollywood NewsTimes MobileGadgets NowCareersColombiaCopyright © 2024 Bennett, Coleman & Co.
