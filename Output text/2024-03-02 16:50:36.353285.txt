It will be held for the 'Pran Pratishtha' so that it goes off smoothly," BJP national spokesperson RP Singh said.advertisement"There is a great history of connection between Sikhs, Lord Ram and Ayodhya, The key evidence on which even the Supreme Court relied was Guru Nanak Dev Ji's visit to the Ram temple in 1510.

It involves an unbroken, continuous recitation of the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs.This recitation, which lasts over 48 hours, is accomplished by a team of readers who ensure the words of divine scripture continue to resonate without interruption until the ceremony's conclusion.

RP Singh said that 'Akhand Path' and various programmes have been organised before the Supreme Court's landmark verdict in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid case in 2019."Before the Supreme Court verdict on Ram temple, we did organise 'Akhand Path' at the same Gurdwara in Ayodhya. Sikhs from Kanpur, Hyderabad, Amritsar and other parts of the country participated and prayed for the construction of Ram temple. This 'Akhand Path' is for 'Pran Pratishtha', and the word 'Ram' has been used 2,533 times in the Guru Granth Sahib," he said.By organising the 'Akhand Path', the Sikh community aims not just to demonstrate interfaith solidarity, but also to celebrate the triumph of faith and spirituality that transcends the boundaries of the religion.Published By: Prateek ChakrabortyPublished On: Jan 17, 2024ALSO READ |  'Ram Lalla' idol created by Karnataka sculptor selected, temple trust confirmsALSO READ |  Golden door of Ram Mandir's sanctum sanctorum ready ahead of pran pratishtha.

The primary idol, a 51-inch black granite statue sculpted by the renowned Arun Yogiraj from Mysuru, has been ceremoniously placed in the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. This idol, carved from ancient Krishna Shila stone, embodies the divine innocence of Lord Ram as a child and is adorned with traditional attire and ornaments.
Accompanying this central figure are two other exquisite idols, which, although not chosen for the garbha griha, hold significant places within the temple complex. One, a white marble creation by Satyanarayan Pandey from Rajasthan, depicts Ram Lalla with a golden bow and arrow, set against an arch illustrating Lord Vishnu's avatars. The other, by Ganesh Bhatt from Karnataka, features Ram Lalla with symbols of the Surya dynasty, including Lord Surya on the crown.
These idols, too, will be enshrined within the temple precincts, ensuring that all three manifestations of Ram Lalla receive the veneration they deserve.

As per initial estimates, close to 2.5 lakh devotees had already completed Darshan on Tuesday, and about a lakh more were still waiting for their turn. The high turnout, which far exceeded the administration's expectations, led to extensive security precautions. Despite this immense surge of pilgrims, what stands out from this scenario is the unshakable faith of the devotees, with waves of emotion brimming over across the holy city, a day after the Prana Pratishtha ceremony of Ram Lalla in the grand Ram temple.
