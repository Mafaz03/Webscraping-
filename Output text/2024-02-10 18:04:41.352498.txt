PNG Ports Corporation Limited (PNG Ports) is eyeing increased trade, connectivity and commercial capacity as it prepares to upgrade its non-profitable ports.
Officer-in-charge of PNG Ports Ian Hayden-Smith said at least half of these ports will be rehabilitated using funding from the Australian government.
Mr Hayden-Smith said PNG Ports owns and manages 15 ports, but 12 of these: Rabaul, Kavieng, Lorengau, Buka, Kieta, Daru, Alotau, Oro Bay, Madang, Aitape, Vanimo and Wewak, do not make money and are run as community service obligatory ports.
“These ports rely entirely on the profitable ports of Lae, Motukea and Kimbe to fund their operations.”
“The upgrades will ensure that the ports are fit for purpose facilities which will be able to meet future demands placed by the local economy, and will be more climate and seismic resilient.
“All port upgrade projects are in their early stages undergoing either feasibility studies or designing, with only Kimbe at the post tender evaluation stage.
“PNG Ports is committed to upgrading selected ports, because for a country that relies on maritime trade for access to goods and services, the ports are the critical link for connectivity and economic growth,” he said.
Mr Hayden-Smith said PNG Ports attracted a blended financial package of K1.5 billion from the Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific (AIFFP) after launching its first ever 30-year Port Master Plan two years ago.
“The master plan highlighted the state of the port facilities on average as ‘very poor’ and ‘required urgent repair’ prompting the financial package, which is part of a bilateral sovereign loan between the Australian government and PNG government.
“The ports of Kimbe, Kavieng, Lorengau and Oro Bay will be upgraded using the AIFFP funds. Daru will be upgraded utilising a grant from the government of Australia outside of the AIFFP funding. 
The port upgrades are in line with the current government’s Connect PNG agenda,” he said.
