The Hela Wigmen will relocate to Tari by 2025 but they will host some home games in the 2024 Digicel Cup competition as their home ground stadium would be completed by mid this year, Hela Governor Philip Undialu said.The K10 million stadium was halted by 14 months due to a legal proceeding taken against the provincial government by an Incorporated Land Group who claimed ownership of the land, although the land was outrightly purchased from the landowner.However, he said the court has directed for meditation and they would start the process by February this year, and that will not affect the construction of the stadium.“This stadium is made of steel, no scaffolding is used, only metal is used to construct the stadium seats and the foundation. It is co-funded by Kumul Petroleum Holdings Limited (K5m) and the Hela Provincial Government (K5m).Mr Undialu said since 2013, the Hela Wigmen has been operating in Lae and Port Moresby because they do not have a home stadium, despite winning some premiership titles.“Therefore, we have constructed our own stadium and we have to complete it before June this year and hopefully host several Wigmen home games by June,” he said.Mr Undialu said the first stage of the stadium with a capacity of 7000 seats is now under construction and the contractor, China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CECC) is working on the grandstand and is putting up the roof.“I’m happy the Stadium is taking shape. The roofing and the final touches are being done on the first stage of the stadium. The first stage will have a smaller capacity of about 7000 but that will increase in the second stage development of the stadium, which will have a total capacity of 10,000 seats. The second phase will be bigger and will have a top floor for VIPS and the media, and it will also consist of a cafeteria. The main grandstand will have a double floor,” he said.Also included in the second phase of the development will be a 50-men Wigmen Hotel, a hotel dedicated to the Wigmen, and will be managed by a management team to generate revenue for the club.The hotel will also have a swimming pool, gym and other facilities with rooms for the players while other rooms will be up for guests.The stadium will also have several kiosks to lease out, a source of revenue for the club.He said the club must raise its own funds to sustain its operation in the years to come and the Wigmen Hotel, the kiosk and the gate takings are some revenue streams for the Wigmen club they are looking at, as their current sponsor will not always be around to support the team.Governor Undialu said the Hela Provincial Government will also partner the three districts of Koroba Kopiago-Komo-Hulia and Magarima to build mini stadiums in the three districts.He said the stadium will also be used for other activities such as big church gatherings, cultural events and sporting events.

The Kokopo Central Business District’s Williams Road is gradually becoming more and more dotted with potholes.
On a busy day, the traffic stalls. Vehicles that attempt to avoid these potholes pose risks to pedestrians as they cross the main road to shops or the main market.
The main crossing from the Kokopo market to K Central supermarket is always busy and potholes have also riddled this main crossing.

The development forum and development and construction of the P’ynang gas project in the Western Province will come after the completion of the construction phase of the Papua LNG project.
Minister for Petroleum Kerenga Kua said while responding to questions without notice from Western Governor Taboi Awi Yoto who wanted to know when the development forum for the landowners, the provincial government, the affected LLG and the State will be conducted.
The Governor also wanted to know when the State would pass the P’ynang Gas Fiscal Stability Act to give the provincial government and the affected district development authority (DDA) access to the tune of K150 million as tax credit fund as captured in the gas agreement.
Mr Kua in his response said there are two similar projects within the same region, the Elk Antelope in Gulf and the Pynang in the Western Province, and they share the same geographical region.
Therefore, the government has sequenced the two projects, by firstly starting off with the development and the construction of the Papuan LNG project hopefully by 2024 and then move over to Pýnang, running back to back within the space of 4 years.
This means that the Development Forum for Pynanag will take place in 2027 and the construction and the development would start in 2028.
Mr Kua said this sequencing is basically to run parallel simultaneously, and that is due to the fact that the country is small with a small public service, and they cannot be engaged in two similar projects at once, as technically skilled fields like these requires a lot of work.
He said the State need not only the public servants but the skilled private sector contractors in such big projects and with a small workforce, they cannot be engaged in two major highly skilled projects concurrently.
The Minister said the other reason is for the greater benefit of the country’s economy, and that is to expand the economic benefits so the economy is sustained for a longer period and not to run concurrently and collapse the economy.

The Edevu hydro power station construction is on schedule, with all work to be completed by the end of September, 2023.
The Edevu power project, opened in April this year, will supply 54 megawatts into the Port Moresby grid with 2x turbines each producing 27 megawatts.
The current peak loan demand in Port Moresby grid is 132 megawatts.
PNG Power chairman McRonald Nale said Edevu’s bigger sized generating units with higher inertia will add stability to the Port Moresby grid.
“With Edevu, Port Moresby grid will have an improved ability to withstand electrical shocks and disturbances, thereby reducing network blackouts. 
Having high inertia machines from Edevu will significantly reduce total system outages caused by network cascading effects. 
Edevu hydro power brings clean, fuel free and low-cost power to supply increasing demand in the Port Moresby grid,” Mr Nale said.
PPL estimates about 40 to 50 megawatts are produced and utilised by large industries off grid due to reliability issues.
“With low cost power from Edevu hydro, this will improve network regulation and improved attention to our customers through a range of initiatives, including Amnesty Program and Feeder Team Management, we believe the industries not on the PPL grid will reconnect,” Mr Nale said.
PNG Hydro Development Ltd managing director Allan Guo said the total towers of the main transmission lines to be built from Edevu to the Moitaka is 104.
“Work on erecting and stringing of towers is completed from tower 1- tower 39. From tower 39 — 89, erection of towers completed without stringing. 
This week, our contractors will be working on towers 90 — 95, that is doing the foundation work and so forth,” Mr Guo said.
By the end of September, PNG Power will officially do the technical commissioning for the Edevu Hydro Power Station, and will run on full operation for three days, before final tests are done and the official commissioning takes place.

Growth in Mobile and Telecommunication companies like Digicel Pacific and Vodafone PNG is raising concerns for regulations on location for building mobile communication towers across the country.
Digicel Pacific and Vodafone PNG recently announced their intention to increase their reach, 
spiking the need for building more telecommunication towers and to ensure that it does not interfere or pose any harm to the people, space and infrastructure.
The Post-Courier understands that there has been very little update from the National Information and Communication Technology Authority on the process for developing these regulatory guidelines to guide the construction of mobile communication towers.
NICTA released a public notice on April 29, 2022, stating that it was in consultation with the industry to develop guidelines for the construction of towers.
In the notice, NICTA issued few orders which are to be observed by the mobile network operators, tower owners and general public.
The orders issued also prohibits the construction of mobile towers within 200 metres of existing towers, schools or hospitals and in residential areas, industrial areas or near highways and main roads.
In December 2022, NICTA chief executive officer Kila Gulo-Vui, said the consultation process of developing the guidelines was under way and NICTA was engaging with the industry and city authority to develop these guidelines.
He said the industry is aware of the regulator’s expectations and they are providing their responses.
“We will go through the process and when the consultation is completed and everything is finalised, NICTA will make the announcement for the industry to be aware of,” Mr Gulo-Vui said.
He said they are currently in dialogue with concerned stakeholders on the existing towers built in public areas and which should be at least 200 metres to the existing infrastructure such as schools or hospitals and in residential, industrial areas or near highways and main roads.

MORE and more women are joining building and construction trades, an industry traditionally dominated by men.LizApril Fisa and Sharon Katari are part of this new generation of women in the building and construction industry. Their stories will serve as an inspiration to other women and girls who wish to enter similar skilled technical trades in their career.Employed by Digara Construction Ltd, LizApril and Sharon are proud to be part of the company’s current project- the construction of a new 40-bed female dormitory at the University of Papua New Guinea’s School of Medicine and Health Sciences, funded by a Papua New Guinea-Australia Partnership Incentive Fund grant of K8.1 million.
Companies like Digara have seen the benefits of employing women and are keen to support and en[1]courage their female workers and provide an avenue for Papua New Guinean women to apply their trade skills.Given the project is targeted at improving access to quality education and increasing employment opportunities for women, the focus on having women construction workers participating in the building sector is welcomed.For Ms Fisa, from Tufi in the Northern Province, joining Digara was an opportunity she couldn’t pass up on. She is determined to make her mark in the industry.
“It’s kind of tough. When I first came (to this project), there weren’t any females,” Ms Fisa said.“I was like, man, how am I going to survive here? But then again, I’m the only girl in a family full of boys so, I was like, just treat them well, just like how I treat my brothers at home.“Talk to them properly and make them feel comfortable because most of these guys have never worked with a female co-worker before so it’s quite hard to communicate and talk to them.” Her collaborative approach has paid off.
“I usually initiate discussions and always put myself out there and say hey, I’m here – you need anything, you need help or whatever let me know,” Ms Fisa said.“That’s my approach.” And after being on the job as an electrical assistant for just three months, she is already noticing a shift in behaviour by her male colleagues.“They are comfortable with me being around. At first, they were like, we have a female, and we are very careful with how we speak,” she said.“Because there were no females around in the first place, they expressed themselves freely.It’s different now, they are very mindful and respectful towards us.”In fact, Ms Fisa has been inspired by her experiences on the project that she hopes to continue in the construction industry and become a licensed electrician in the future. Ms Katari from Lufa in the Eastern Highlands Province has been in the trade for a lot longer than Ms Fisa, starting with Digara four years ago as a welder.But she agrees that women face particular challenges in the industry, especially juggling working and being a mother to a two-year-old son.“I’m proud to be in this field – I wouldn’t let the opportunity go by like that. I can’t let motherhood hinder my professional career,” Ms Katari said.“There is always a balance in what I do and I’m enjoying it right now.The most important achievement for me is doing a good job and being recognised by the company I work for.”At Digara, she is responsible for assembling pieces of metal together, repairing damage in metal components as well as reviewing blueprints, cutting metal, and smoothing molten metal to remove creases.

“These institutions are agency run institutions which have been serving the province and country for years” he said.Mr Yengaha said there has been no proper development done on the road for almost a decade.He said it is not safe for them to walk from the college down to the Kalabond field because of the ongoing holdups.
“I am urging relevant authorities, the district development authority and the provincial government to do something about it,” he said.

UPNG journalism studentThousands of people living in the Gerehu suburb in Port Moresby will for the next 12 months experience difficulties in commuting following the start of a year long road construction.After the completion of the first construction of the main area road from Gerehu stage one to stage six, another year construction work is underway in the corridors of Gerehu, along the bus stop next to the Bismillah shops.
According to Phoenix Construction who has undertaken the project, the half a mile road structure starting from the Gerehu main bus stop roundabout to the Kasia Cycle roundabout is anticipated to cause traffic congestion that will definitely impact daily commuters.Phoenix site engineer, Philimon Mondolame said the new road construction progress will depend on the funding from the National Capital District Commission.“The reason for working at one section of the road at a time is because the funding is not paid in full but in installments so the funds are released when a block of the road is completed,” he said.
Another factor that significantly affect construction is weather as periods of heavy rain hinder any progress.Mr Mondale noted that traffic is currently being controlled by blocking the road in front of Gerehu Mart in order to work on the left side of the bus stop.Once the bus stop is completed then the blockade will be shifted and normalcy should return.

It was a first of its kind in the history of the Telefomin people to access a new road.This new road from Tabubil, Western province connecting the first village, Urapmin in Telefomin district of West Sepik province was launched last Friday.The Urapmin villagers including nearby villages in the district and North Fly people, Tabubil and Kiunga turned out in numbers to witness the launching ceremony.Urapmin ward president Siniki Babeloki said it is a new beginning for them.“We have over 700 people in this village and we are so happy.“We walk for three days and nights to reach Tabubil.“We carry store goods, iron sheets, teaching materials and other things from Tabubil and walk back through the cold, foggy and rugged mountainous terrain to reach Telefomin.“Some of our people have died along this bush tracks.” he said.Mr Babeloki said seeing the machinery and trucks in the village is a joyous experience as the construction of the road means they can now reach Tabubil by truck and return home the same day.Telefomin district administrator Joshua Himina said the lack of road has been a major hindrance for delivery of services.However, this road will enable them to see more changes in the district.“New roads linking nearby villages will be done, health centres, schools and other services as well. All of these services are captured in our five -year development plan,” he said.It took six years since 2018 to construct road connecting Western and West Sepik provinces.Other eight kilometres of road construction from Urapmin village to Telefomin station will continue this month and further road construction will continue to Oksapmin rural LLG starting this year.The engineers from the contractor Ipwenz Construction Limited (IPZ), other sub- contractors with support from Ok Tedi Mine through the tax credit scheme under the Connect PNG program have helped established the road.Deputy Prime Minister John Rosso, Minister for Works and Highways and Telefomin MP Solan Mirisim, Labour Minister and Rai Coast MP Kessy Sawang, Hela Governor Philip Undialu, OTML managing director Kedi Ilimbit and other dignitaries witnessed the event last Friday.

                                                                                    -  
Chinese president Xi Jinping opened the Belt and Road forum in Beijing on Wednesday, with a message that China "can only do well when the world is doing well".
China is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) which has extended Chinese economic and geopolitical influence across the globe. 
In his opening speech, Xi promised to extend access to China's market for international firms and for new financing exceeding $100 billion for other developing economies.
He added that two Chinese-backed development banks – the China Development Bank and the Export–Import Bank of China – will each set 350 billion yuan ($47.9 billion) financing windows, while an additional 80 billion yuan ($11 billion) will be injected into the Silk Road Fund to support BRI projects.
"Viewing other’s development as a threat, or taking economic interdependence as a risk will not make one’s own life better or speed up one’s own development," Xi said.
"We have learned that the silk road spirit of peace and cooperation, mutual learning and mutual benefit, openness and win-win is the most important source of strength for the Belt and Road cooperation."
The initiative has deepened China's relations with Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Middle East through large infrastructure projects such as power plants, roads, railroads and ports. 
As for China-Africa cooperation, one of the BRI's most significant features is its emphasis on green infrastructure projects and renewable energy development.
Of the representatives from more than 130 mostly developing countries attending the forum, including at least 20 heads of state and government, several African leaders are present. 
Kenyan's President William Ruto and Ethiopia's President Abiy Ahmed, amongst others, are in attendance.
